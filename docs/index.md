# Gemmology Knowledge

**FGA Curriculum Documentation** - Comprehensive reference materials for coloured gemstone expertise aligned with the Gemmological Association of Great Britain (Gem-A) Foundation and Diploma curriculum.

Part of the [Gemmology Project](https://gemmology.dev).

## Overview

The Gemmology Knowledge repository provides:

- **13 Knowledge Modules** covering core gemmological topics
- **Quick Reference Sheets** for rapid data lookup
- **Study Guides** aligned with FGA Foundation and Diploma courses
- **Glossary** of gemmological terminology

All content is designed to be both human-readable documentation and machine-consumable knowledge for AI-assisted gem identification and education.

## Quick Start

### For Students

1. Start with the [Study Guides](study-guides/fga-foundation.md) for curriculum-aligned learning
2. Use [Quick Reference](quick-reference/index.md) sheets during practical sessions
3. Explore [Knowledge Modules](modules.md) for in-depth topics

### For Practitioners

1. Use the search function to find specific topics
2. Reference the [Glossary](glossary.md) for terminology
3. Consult module reference files for detailed data

## Integration

This knowledge base integrates with the [gemmology-plugin](https://github.com/gemmology-dev/gemmology-plugin) Claude Code plugin to provide AI-assisted gem identification and education.

### Skills Activation

Skills are automatically activated based on trigger keywords:

```
User: What causes the colour in ruby?
AI: [Activates chemical-properties skill]
    Ruby's red colour is caused by chromium (Cr³⁺) substituting...
```

### Cross-Module References

Skills can reference each other for comprehensive answers:

```
User: How do I identify a natural ruby?
AI: [Activates: inclusions-fingerprints, treatments-enhancements, gem-testing-instruments]
```
