!!! info "Terminology"
    - **Synthetic** - Same composition as natural (lab ruby = synthetic corundum)
    - **Simulant** - Different material resembling another (CZ simulates diamond)
    - **Imitation** - Any material imitating another (glass "ruby")

## Flame Fusion (Verneuil)

The oldest and most economical method (1902).

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Curved striae | Diagnostic curved growth lines |
| Gas bubbles | Spherical or elongated |
| Colour | More uniform than natural |

**Materials:** Ruby, sapphire, spinel, star corundum

## Flux Growth

Slow growth from molten flux solution.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Flux inclusions | Wispy veils, fingerprints |
| Metallic platelets | Platinum/gold from crucible |

**Producers:** Chatham, Ramaura, Kashan

## Hydrothermal Growth

Growth in high-pressure aqueous solutions.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Seed plate | Visible boundary |
| Chevron zoning | Zigzag patterns |
| Nail-head spicules | Pointed inclusions |

**Materials:** Quartz, emerald

## Lab-Grown Diamond

| HPHT | CVD |
|------|-----|
| High pressure/temperature | Carbon from gas |
| Metallic flux | Lower pressure |
| Often yellow tint | Often brown |
| Metallic inclusions | Striated growth |

## Detection Summary

| Method | Key Features |
|--------|--------------|
| Flame Fusion | Curved striae, gas bubbles |
| Flux | Flux inclusions, metallic platelets |
| Hydrothermal | Seed plate, chevron zoning |
| HPHT Diamond | Metallic inclusions, fluorescence |
| CVD Diamond | Striated growth, spectral features |

!!! warning "Professional Testing"
    Some high-quality synthetics require advanced laboratory testing for definitive identification.
