  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Gemmological testing relies on a suite of standard instruments that measure optical and
      physical properties. Mastering these tools is fundamental to gem identification and
      forms the core practical skills tested in the FGA Foundation examination.

      A systematic approach using multiple instruments provides the most reliable identification.
      No single test is definitive—results should be correlated across several methods.

  - title: The Refractometer
    content: |
      The refractometer is the most important gemmological instrument. It measures refractive
      index (RI) by observing the critical angle of total internal reflection at the
      gem-to-glass interface.
    subsections:
      - title: How It Works
        content: |
          Light enters through the gemstone placed on a high-RI glass hemisphere. At angles
          greater than the critical angle, light is totally internally reflected, creating
          a shadow edge on the scale. This edge corresponds to the gem's RI.

          - **Contact liquid** (RI ~1.81) bridges the gap between gem and glass
          - **Scale range** typically 1.35–1.81
          - **Monochromatic light** (sodium yellow, 589nm) provides accurate readings

      - title: Faceted Stone Technique
        content: |
          1. Place a small drop of contact liquid on the hemisphere
          2. Position the stone table-down on the liquid
          3. Look through the eyepiece at the scale
          4. Rotate the stone to find maximum and minimum RI readings
          5. For uniaxial stones: two readings (ω and ε)
          6. For biaxial stones: three readings (α, β, γ) but only two visible at once

      - title: Cabochon (Spot Reading) Technique
        content: |
          For curved surfaces, use the spot method:

          1. Use minimum contact liquid
          2. Look for a spot of light rather than a shadow edge
          3. The spot's position on the scale indicates approximate RI
          4. Less accurate than faceted readings (±0.01)
          5. Useful for rough assessment of cabochons and beads

      - title: Troubleshooting
        content: |
          - **No reading**: Stone may have RI above contact liquid limit (>1.81)
          - **Fuzzy edge**: Birefringent stone, dirty contact, or poor polish
          - **Moving readings**: High birefringence; rotate and record both values
          - **Very faint reading**: Improve lighting or check stone position

      title: Stones Above Refractometer Limits
      text: |
        Stones with RI above 1.81 cannot be measured on standard refractometers:

        - **Diamond** (RI 2.417) - Use thermal probe or specific gravity
        - **Zircon** (RI 1.93–1.98) - May show partial reading
        - **Demantoid** (RI 1.88) - SG and spectrum for identification
        - **Sphene** (RI 1.90–2.02) - Identify by high dispersion and birefringence

  - title: The Polariscope
    content: |
      The polariscope uses two polarising filters to determine a gem's optical character
      (isotropic vs. anisotropic) and can reveal strain, twinning, and anomalous double
      refraction (ADR).
    subsections:
      - title: Components and Setup
        content: |
          - **Polariser**: Lower filter, fixed position
          - **Analyser**: Upper filter, can rotate
          - **Light source**: Below the polariser
          - **Crossed polars**: Filters at 90° (dark field)

          Place the gem between crossed polars and rotate it 360°.

      - title: Isotropic vs Anisotropic Test
        table:
          headers:
            - Observation
            - Interpretation
          rows:
            - ["Remains dark during rotation", "Isotropic (cubic system or amorphous)"]
            - ["Light and dark every 90° (4× blink)", "Anisotropic (crystalline, non-cubic)"]
            - ["Remains light (never dark)", "Aggregate or microcrystalline material"]
            - ["Patchy light/dark (tabby extinction)", "ADR or strain birefringence"]

      - title: Anomalous Double Refraction (ADR)
        content: |
          Some isotropic materials show strain birefringence due to internal stress:

          - **Garnet**: Often shows ADR (especially almandine)
          - **Spinel**: May show ADR, particularly synthetic
          - **Diamond**: Can show strain patterns

          ADR appears as irregular light patches that don't follow the normal 4× blink pattern.

  - title: The Dichroscope
    content: |
      The dichroscope reveals pleochroism by showing two polarised images side by side.
      It's essential for identifying coloured anisotropic gems.
    subsections:
      - title: Types
        content: |
          - **Calcite dichroscope**: Uses calcite rhomb to split image; more accurate
          - **Polaroid dichroscope**: Uses polarising film; more affordable

      - title: Usage Technique
        content: |
          1. View the gem through the dichroscope with strong transmitted light
          2. Rotate the dichroscope (not the gem) while observing
          3. Look for colour differences between the two images
          4. Rotate the gem to find the direction of maximum colour difference
          5. Record both colours seen

      - title: Interpreting Results
        table:
          headers:
            - Observation
            - Interpretation
          rows:
            - ["Two identical colours", "Isotropic or viewing down optic axis"]
            - ["Two different colours", "Dichroic (uniaxial) gem"]
            - ["Three colours (rotate gem)", "Trichroic (biaxial) gem"]
            - ["No colour", "Colourless or very pale stone"]

        - ["Peridot", "Weak", "Yellow-green / green"]
        - ["Aquamarine", "Weak", "Colourless / pale blue"]

  - title: The Spectroscope
    content: |
      The spectroscope displays the absorption spectrum of a gem, showing which wavelengths
      of light are absorbed. Certain absorption patterns are diagnostic for specific gems
      and treatments.
    subsections:
      - title: Types
        content: |
          - **Prism spectroscope**: Spreads red end more; better resolution in red
          - **Diffraction grating**: Even spread across spectrum; easier wavelength estimation

      - title: Setup and Technique
        content: |
          1. Use strong white light transmitted through the gem
          2. Position slit close to the stone
          3. Focus on the spectrum (adjust eyepiece)
          4. Look for dark lines or bands against the coloured spectrum
          5. Note position (wavelength in nm) and width of features

      - title: Recording Spectra
        content: |
          Record observations systematically:

          - **Lines**: Sharp, narrow features (atomic absorption)
          - **Bands**: Broader absorption regions
          - **Cut-off**: Absorption of entire spectral region (e.g., blue cut-off)
          - **Position**: Wavelength in nanometres (nm)

        - ["Peridot", "Fe bands", "493, 473, 453 (three evenly spaced)"]

  - title: The Chelsea Filter
    content: |
      The Chelsea filter transmits only deep red and yellow-green light. It was designed
      to distinguish Colombian emerald (appears red) from its simulants.
    subsections:
      - title: How It Works
        content: |
          - Chromium-coloured gems transmit red light → appear **pink to red**
          - Non-chromium green gems absorb red → appear **green or grey**
          - The filter is named after the Chelsea Polytechnic where it was developed

      - title: Results and Limitations
        table:
          headers:
            - Stone
            - Chelsea Filter Reaction
          rows:
            - ["Colombian emerald", "Pink to red (Cr content)"]
            - ["Zambian emerald", "May appear greenish (Fe content)"]
            - ["Green glass", "Green or grey"]
            - ["Green tourmaline", "Remains green"]
            - ["Synthetic emerald", "Strong red (high Cr)"]
            - ["Blue aquamarine", "Green"]
            - ["Blue cobalt glass", "Red (cobalt)"]
            - ["Blue synthetic spinel", "Red (cobalt)"]

  - title: Chelsea Filter Warning
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Limitations
      text: |
        The Chelsea filter is NOT diagnostic for emerald! Synthetic emeralds also appear red,
        and some natural emeralds (especially Zambian) may not show strong red. Always use
        additional tests including RI, inclusions, and spectrum.

  - title: The UV Lamp
    content: |
      Ultraviolet fluorescence can be diagnostic for certain gems and treatments.
      Two wavelengths are used: long-wave (LWUV, 365nm) and short-wave (SWUV, 254nm).
    subsections:
      - title: LWUV vs SWUV
        content: |
          - **LWUV (365nm)**: Safer, penetrates deeper, often stronger reactions
          - **SWUV (254nm)**: More diagnostic reactions, requires eye protection
          - Different gems may react differently to each wavelength
          - Always test in complete darkness for accurate observation

      - title: Safety Considerations
        content: |
          - Never look directly at UV light source
          - Wear UV-blocking glasses, especially with SWUV
          - Limit exposure time
          - Keep children away from UV equipment

  - title: The Microscope
    content: |
      The gemmological microscope is essential for studying inclusions, growth features,
      and signs of treatment. Magnifications from 10× to 60× are typically used.
    subsections:
      - title: Magnification Ranges
        content: |
          - **10×**: Standard loupe magnification; overview examination
          - **20–40×**: Detailed inclusion study
          - **60×+**: Fine details, surface features

      - title: Immersion Technique
        content: |
          Immersing the gem in a liquid of similar RI reduces surface reflections and reveals
          internal features more clearly.

          - **Methylene iodide** (RI 1.74): Good for corundum, spinel
          - **Benzyl benzoate** (RI 1.57): Good for quartz, beryl
          - **Water** (RI 1.33): Basic immersion, safe for all gems

          *Note*: Some immersion liquids are toxic; use appropriate safety measures.

        For unknown gems, follow this sequence:

        1. **Visual examination**: Colour, transparency, lustre, cut style
        2. **Refractometer**: RI and birefringence
        3. **Polariscope**: Optic character (SR/DR)
        4. **Dichroscope**: Pleochroism (if coloured and DR)
        5. **Microscope**: Inclusions, growth features
        6. **Spectroscope**: Absorption spectrum
        7. **UV lamp**: Fluorescence reactions
        8. **Chelsea filter**: If green stone
        9. **SG**: If refractometer inconclusive or OTL

        Document all results before reaching a conclusion.
