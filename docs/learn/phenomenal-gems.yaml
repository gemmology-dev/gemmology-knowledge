  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Phenomenal gems display special optical effects caused by their internal structure,
      inclusions, or interference of light. These phenomena are highly prized and can
      significantly increase a gem's value.

      Understanding the causes of each phenomenon helps in identification, quality
      assessment, and distinguishing natural from synthetic or treated stones.

  - title: Asterism (Star Effect)
    content: |
      Asterism is the appearance of a star pattern on the surface of a cabochon-cut gem.
      It is caused by light reflecting from oriented needle-like inclusions (usually
      rutile silk) arranged parallel to crystallographic directions.
    subsections:
      - title: How Stars Form
        content: |
          - Needle inclusions must be oriented along **specific crystal directions**
          - Light reflects from each set of needles, creating a bright band
          - Multiple intersecting needle orientations create multiple rays
          - The stone must be cut **en cabochon** with the base parallel to needle planes
          - Proper orientation during cutting is critical for centred stars

            - ["Four-ray star", "4", "Two sets of needles at 90°", "Star diopside, some garnets"]
            - ["Twelve-ray star", "12", "Two overlapping 6-ray patterns", "Rare star corundum, star beryl"]

      - title: Star Ruby and Star Sapphire
        content: |
          Corundum is the most important source of star gems. The rutile silk (TiO₂ needles)
          forms along the hexagonal crystal structure, creating three intersecting sets of
          needles at 120° angles.

          **Quality factors:**
          - **Sharpness**: Crisp, well-defined rays
          - **Centering**: Star centred on the dome
          - **Body colour**: Colour saturation of the host gem
          - **Transparency**: Semi-translucent to opaque
          - **Star mobility**: Moves smoothly with light source

      type: warning
      title: Synthetic and Treated Stars
      text: |
        **Synthetic star corundum** (Linde stars) show very sharp, perfectly straight rays
        and often have gas bubbles. Natural stars have slightly softer rays due to natural
        silk irregularity.

        **Diffusion-treated stars** have star effect only in a thin surface layer. Immersion
        in methylene iodide reveals colour and silk concentrated at the surface.

  - title: Chatoyancy (Cat's Eye Effect)
    content: |
      Chatoyancy is a single band of light that moves across a cabochon surface, resembling
      a cat's eye. It requires parallel needle or tube inclusions oriented in one direction.
    subsections:
      - title: Mechanism
        content: |
          - Parallel fibrous or tubular inclusions
          - Must be cut en cabochon **perpendicular** to inclusion direction
          - Light reflects from the sides of inclusions
          - Creates a single bright band (chatoyant band)

      - title: Chrysoberyl Cat's Eye
        content: |
          Chrysoberyl cat's eye (cymophane) is the finest and most valuable chatoyant gem.
          Only chrysoberyl may be called simply "cat's eye"; all others require qualification
          (e.g., "quartz cat's eye").

          **Key characteristics:**
          - Strong, sharp chatoyant band
          - Honey yellow to green body colour
          - "Milk and honey" effect: band separates lighter and darker zones when lit from side
          - Fine, dense silk creates superior cats' eyes

      type: info
      title: Milk and Honey Effect
      text: |
        In fine chrysoberyl cat's eye, when lit from one side, the chatoyant band divides
        the stone into a "milk" (lighter, opaque) zone and "honey" (darker, transparent) zone.
        This effect indicates dense, even silk distribution and is a sign of quality.

  - title: Adularescence
    content: |
      Adularescence is the soft, billowy, bluish-white glow that moves across moonstone.
      It appears to float just below the surface and has a distinctly ethereal quality.
    subsections:
      - title: Cause
        content: |
          Moonstone is a feldspar with alternating layers of orthoclase and albite created
          during cooling. When these layers are thin enough (approaching the wavelength of
          light), they scatter light through interference.

          - Layer thickness determines colour: thin layers produce blue; thicker layers produce white
          - Best adularescence requires layers ~0.1 μm thick
          - The effect is best seen on properly oriented cabochons

      - title: Types of Moonstone

          rows:
            - ["Classical moonstone", "Orthoclase", "Blue-white schiller", "Colourless to grey"]
            - ["Rainbow moonstone", "Labradorite", "Multicoloured flashes", "Translucent white"]
            - ["Peach moonstone", "Orthoclase", "White schiller", "Peach to orange"]

      - title: Quality Factors
        content: |
          - **Colour of schiller**: Blue is most prized, then white
          - **Intensity**: Strong, visible adularescence
          - **Body colour**: Colourless preferred; grey or yellow less desirable
          - **Transparency**: More transparent = higher value
          - **Centred effect**: Adularescence centred on dome

  - title: Labradorescence
    content: |
      Labradorescence is the striking play of colours seen in labradorite feldspar.
      Unlike adularescence, it displays a full spectrum of colours including blue, green,
      gold, orange, and purple.
    subsections:
      - title: Mechanism
        content: |
          Caused by light interference from lamellar twinning (repeated thin twin layers)
          within the feldspar structure. The twin lamellae vary in thickness, producing
          different interference colours.

          - Most prominent on specific crystal planes (001 cleavage)
          - Requires proper cutting orientation to display effect
          - Colours appear in patches or broad flashes

      - title: Spectrolite
        content: |
          Finnish labradorite showing the full colour spectrum is called **spectrolite**.
          It typically displays vivid blues, greens, oranges, and purples in the same stone.
          Spectrolite commands premium prices.

  - title: Play of Colour
    content: |
      Play of colour is the flashing spectral colours seen in precious opal. It is opal's
      defining characteristic and distinguishes precious opal from common opal.
    subsections:
      - title: Cause
        content: |
          Opal is composed of orderly stacked spheres of hydrated silica (SiO₂·nH₂O).
          When spheres are uniform in size (150–400 nm) and regularly arranged, they
          diffract light like a three-dimensional grating.

          - Sphere size determines colours: larger spheres produce red; smaller produce blue/violet
          - Regularity of arrangement affects brightness
          - Random sphere sizes produce common (potch) opal with no play of colour

            - ["Flame", "Sweeping streaks of colour", "Medium"]

      - title: Opal Body Tone and Transparency
        content: |
          - **Black opal**: Dark grey to black body; colours appear most vivid
          - **White opal**: Light body tone; common, lower value
          - **Crystal opal**: Transparent; can show play from both surfaces
          - **Fire opal**: Orange to red body; may lack play of colour
          - **Boulder opal**: Ironstone matrix with opal veins

      - title: Precious vs Common Opal
        content: |
          - **Precious opal**: Shows play of colour; spheres regularly arranged
          - **Common opal (potch)**: No play of colour; irregular sphere arrangement
          - **Fire opal**: Valued for body colour (orange/red); play of colour optional

  - title: Colour Change
    content: |
      Colour-change gems display different colours under different light sources
      (typically daylight vs incandescent). The most famous is alexandrite, which appears
      green in daylight and red in incandescent light.
    subsections:
      - title: Mechanism
        content: |
          Colour change occurs when a gem's absorption spectrum has a transmission window
          that straddles two spectral regions. The different spectral compositions of light
          sources cause different colours to be perceived.

          - Daylight: Balanced spectrum → reveals one colour
          - Incandescent: Rich in red, poor in blue → reveals another colour
          - LED/fluorescent: Variable results depending on spectrum

      - title: Alexandrite
        content: |
          Alexandrite is colour-change chrysoberyl, coloured by chromium. It shows:

          - **Daylight**: Green to blue-green
          - **Incandescent**: Red to purple-red
          - **Percentage change**: Quality measure (100% = complete colour shift)

          Fine alexandrite with strong colour change is extremely rare and valuable.
          Russian (Ural) alexandrite historically set the standard.

      - title: Other Colour-Change Gems
        table:
          headers:
            - Gem
            - Daylight
            - Incandescent
            - Cause
          rows:
            - ["Alexandrite", "Green", "Red", "Chromium"]
            - ["Colour-change sapphire", "Blue/violet", "Purple/pink", "Vanadium"]
            - ["Colour-change garnet", "Blue-green", "Red-purple", "Vanadium + chromium"]
            - ["Colour-change spinel", "Blue", "Violet", "Cobalt or iron"]
            - ["Colour-change diaspore", "Yellow-green", "Pink-red", "Manganese"]

      - title: Grading Colour Change
        content: |
          Colour change is graded by the percentage shift between colours:

          - **100%**: Complete colour change (green ↔ red with no overlap)
          - **75–99%**: Strong colour change
          - **50–74%**: Moderate colour change
          - **<50%**: Weak colour change

          Both colours should be attractive for maximum value.

  - title: Aventurescence
    content: |
      Aventurescence is a glittery, metallic reflection from flat, reflective inclusions
      within a gem. The effect is named after aventurine glass (from Italian "avventura"
      meaning chance).
    subsections:
      - title: Sunstone
        content: |
          Sunstone is feldspar with metallic schiller from oriented platelets:

          - **Oregon sunstone**: Copper platelets; unique to Oregon
          - **Indian sunstone**: Hematite or goethite platelets
          - **Norwegian sunstone**: Hematite platelets

          Oregon sunstone may show both aventurescence and transparent areas, sometimes
          with copper "schiller" creating localised colour.

      - title: Aventurine Quartz
        content: |
          Green aventurine contains fuchsite mica (Cr-mica) platelets that create green
          colour and sparkle. Less commonly, hematite inclusions create orange-red
          aventurine quartz.

  - title: Iridescence
    content: |
      Iridescence is a display of spectral colours caused by light interference from
      thin layers or structures near the surface.
    subsections:
      - title: Surface vs Internal Iridescence
        content: |
          - **Surface iridescence**: Thin film on surface (treated topaz coatings)
          - **Internal iridescence**: Within the stone (fire agate, ammolite)

      - title: Fire Agate
        content: |
          Fire agate shows iridescent "flames" from thin layers of iron oxide (goethite/
          limonite) deposited during formation. The botryoidal (grape-like) surface creates
          unique three-dimensional colour patterns.

      - title: Ammolite
        content: |
          Ammolite is fossilised ammonite shell (aragonite) from Alberta, Canada. The
          nacre layers create brilliant iridescent colours across the entire spectrum.
          It is cut thin and often backed or capped for durability.
