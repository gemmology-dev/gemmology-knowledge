  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Kashmir sapphires are the most prized blue sapphires, known for their unique
      "velvety" or "sleepy" appearance. The deposit in the Zanskar range of the
      Himalayas was discovered in 1881 and largely exhausted by the early 1900s.

      The combination of historical prestige, distinctive appearance, and extreme
      scarcity makes Kashmir the most valuable designation for blue sapphire.

      The Kashmir sapphire story:
    subsections:
      - title: Discovery
        content: |
          - **1881**: Landslide exposed sapphires at ~15,000 ft elevation
          - **Location**: Sumjam, Zanskar range, Jammu & Kashmir
          - **Initial finds**: Large crystals; exceptional quality
          - **Peak production**: 1881-1887

      - title: Decline
        content: |
          - Primary deposit quickly exhausted
          - Sporadic production since
          - Modern mining attempts largely unsuccessful
          - Most Kashmir sapphires are antique or estate pieces

      The distinctive Kashmir "look":
    subsections:
      - title: The Velvety Effect
        content: |
          - **Velvety lustre**: Soft, sleepy appearance from micro-inclusions
          - **Cornflower blue**: Medium-toned, slightly violet-blue
          - **Haze**: Fine particulate inclusions scatter light internally
          - **Effect**: Colours appear to glow from within

      - title: Colour Description
        content: |
          - Medium to medium-dark saturation
          - Pure blue to slightly violet-blue
          - Often shows lighter and darker areas (zoning)
          - Saturation remains attractive even in low light

      title: The Unique Appearance
      text: |
        The "velvety" or "sleepy" appearance of Kashmir sapphires comes from
        microscopic inclusions (particulate clouds, fine needles) that scatter
        light within the stone. This creates a soft, glowing quality unlike
        the glass-like transparency of other sapphires.

        Interestingly, while inclusions normally reduce value, these micro-
        inclusions are prized because they create the distinctive Kashmir look.

      title: Key Identifier
      text: |
        Black tourmaline (schorl) crystals are one of the most diagnostic
        inclusions for Kashmir origin. These prismatic crystals are rarely
        seen in sapphires from other locations.

        Combined with the characteristic velvety appearance and other
        inclusions, tourmaline helps confirm Kashmir origin.

      Kashmir's place in the market:
    subsections:
      - title: Value Premium
        content: |
          - Premiums of 50-100%+ over comparable Ceylon sapphires
          - Fine stones: $100,000-200,000+ per carat at auction
          - Record prices regularly broken
          - Demand exceeds available supply

      - title: Certification Importance
        content: |
          - Laboratory certification essential
          - Multiple labs may be consulted for high-value stones
          - Provenance documentation adds value
          - Treated Kashmir sapphires exist (lower value)

  - title: Authentication Challenges
    content: |
      Confirming Kashmir origin requires expertise:

      - Some Ceylon/Madagascar sapphires share characteristics
      - Heavily heated stones may lose diagnostic features
      - "Kashmir-like" appearance doesn't confirm origin
      - Laboratory analysis of multiple features required
      - Historical documentation valuable but not sufficient alone

  - title: Heat Treatment

      title: Unheated Premium
      text: |
        While heat treatment is less common in Kashmir sapphires than
        other origins, it does occur. Unheated Kashmir sapphires command
        significant premiums over heated examples.

        Heat treatment can reduce or eliminate the characteristic
        velvety appearance, potentially reducing both beauty and value.
