    content: |
      Colombia produces the world's finest emeralds, with Muzo, Chivor, and Coscuez
      being the most famous mines. Colombian emeralds are distinguished by their
      pure green colour and characteristic three-phase inclusions.

      The Colombian emerald trade dates to Spanish colonial times, and the country
      remains the premier source for top-quality emeralds.

      Colombia's three main emerald regions:
    subsections:
      - title: Muzo
        content: |
          - **Location**: Boyacá Department
          - **Character**: Darker, more saturated green
          - **Inclusions**: More included than Chivor
          - **Colour**: Warmer tone; pure green
          - **Reputation**: Often considered finest colour

      - title: Chivor
        content: |
          - **Location**: Boyacá Department (different zone)
          - **Character**: Lighter, often bluish tint
          - **Inclusions**: Generally cleaner than Muzo
          - **Colour**: Cooler tone; slightly bluish-green
          - **Market**: Premium for clean stones

      - title: Coscuez
        content: |
          - **Location**: Near Muzo
          - **Character**: Similar to Muzo
          - **Quality**: Can produce fine material
          - **Volume**: Significant production

      What makes Colombian emeralds distinctive:
    subsections:
      - title: Colour
        content: |
          - **Hue**: Pure green with minimal blue modifier
          - **Saturation**: Medium to highly saturated
          - **Tone**: Medium to medium-dark
          - **Chromophore**: Chromium (with some vanadium)

      - title: The Jardín
        content: |
          Colombian emeralds typically have visible inclusions—the French
          word "jardín" (garden) describes this internal landscape:

          - Inclusions more accepted than in other gems
          - "Eye-clean" emeralds command significant premiums
          - Heavy inclusions can affect durability
          - Inclusions help confirm natural origin

  - title: Three-Phase Inclusions

      title: Diagnostic for Colombia
      text: |
        The three-phase inclusion is virtually diagnostic for Colombian origin:

        - **Liquid** (brine): Fills the cavity
        - **Gas bubble**: Trapped vapour
        - **Halite crystal**: Cubic salt crystal

        The halite cube may dissolve when gently heated and recrystallize
        on cooling. Two-phase inclusions (liquid + gas without halite) occur
        in emeralds from other origins.

      Understanding Colombian emerald treatments:
    subsections:
      - title: Oiling
        content: |
          - Traditional treatment (centuries old)
          - Oil fills surface-reaching fractures
          - Improves apparent clarity
          - **Cedar oil**: Traditional; accepted
          - **Degree matters**: Minor vs significant

      - title: Treatment Grading
        table:
          headers:
            - Level
            - Lab Term
            - Value Impact
          rows:
            - ["None", "None/No oil", "Highest premium"]
            - ["Minor/Insignificant", "Minor", "Slight reduction"]
            - ["Moderate", "Moderate", "Noticeable reduction"]
            - ["Significant", "Significant", "Substantial reduction"]

      - title: Other Treatments
        content: |
          - **Polymer/resin filling**: More stable than oil; must disclose
          - **Surface coating**: Rare; unacceptable
          - **Composite**: Filled fractures become problematic
