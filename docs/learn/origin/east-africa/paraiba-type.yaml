      title: What Is "Paraiba"?
      text: |
        Debate exists whether "Paraiba" refers only to Brazilian origin or
        can apply to any copper-bearing tourmaline with similar colour.

        LMHC (Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee) allows "Paraiba
        tourmaline" for copper-bearing material regardless of origin,
        but origin disclosure is expected on lab reports.

        This means both "Paraiba tourmaline from Mozambique" and "Mozambican
        Paraiba-type tourmaline" are valid descriptions, depending on
        laboratory and trade practice.

  - title: Market Terminology
    content: |
      How the trade describes this material:

      - **"Paraiba tourmaline"**: LMHC-approved for copper-bearing material
      - **"Paraiba-type"**: Alternative emphasizing origin difference
      - **"Mozambican Paraiba"**: Common trade description
      - **Origin disclosure**: Expected and required on reports
      - **Brazilian premium**: Original source still commands 2-5x premium

  - title: Treatment Considerations
    content: |
      Understanding treatment in this material:

      - **Heat treatment**: Common; improves colour, reduces pink/violet
      - **Disclosure**: Required; affects value
      - **Unheated premium**: Clean, unheated stones command premium
      - **Detection**: Laboratory testing can usually identify heating

  - title: Market Position
