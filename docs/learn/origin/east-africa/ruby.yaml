  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      East Africa has emerged as a significant ruby source, with Mozambique's
      Montepuez region now ranking among the world's major producers. Kenya's
      John Saul Mine adds smaller but notable production. These sources are
      filling gaps created by supply constraints from traditional origins.

          - Growing market recognition
          - Typically smaller sizes than Mozambique

  - title: Market Position
    content: |
      East African ruby in the global market:
    subsections:
      - title: Mozambique
        content: |
          - Filling gap from Burmese supply constraints
          - Transparent auctions (Gemfields) set benchmarks
          - Growing acceptance for fine stones
          - Value below Burmese but rising
          - Ethical sourcing programs available

      - title: Kenya
        content: |
          - Established reputation for quality
          - Smaller market share than Mozambique
          - Collector interest for fine pieces
          - Consistent quality when available

  - title: Comparison with Burmese Ruby
    content: |
      Key differences from the benchmark source:

      - **Fluorescence**: Generally weaker due to higher iron
      - **Colour character**: Can match Burmese but often slightly different hue
      - **Inclusions**: Different suite aids origin determination
      - **Price**: Typically 20-50% below Burmese for comparable quality
      - **Market perception**: Improving as supply proves consistent

  - title: Treatment Considerations
    content: |
      Understanding treatment in East African ruby:

      - **Heat treatment**: Common; improves colour and clarity
      - **Unheated premium**: Fine unheated stones command premium
      - **Disclosure**: Expected; Gemfields material well-documented
      - **Beryllium diffusion**: Some material has been treated
      - **Lab reports**: Recommended for significant purchases
