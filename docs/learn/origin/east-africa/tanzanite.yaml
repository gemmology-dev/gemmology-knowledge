  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Tanzanite is Tanzania's signature gemstone and one of the most remarkable
      gem discoveries of the 20th century. Found only in a small area near Mount
      Kilimanjaro, its unique violet-blue colour and single-source rarity have
      made it highly desirable.

  - title: Discovery & Source
    content: |
      The world's only commercial tanzanite deposit:

      - **Discovery**: 1967 by Maasai tribesman
      - **Location**: Merelani Hills, near Mount Kilimanjaro
      - **Exclusivity**: Only known commercial source worldwide
      - **Geology**: Unique conditions in single deposit
      - **Area**: Approximately 4km long by 2km wide

  - title: Characteristics
    content: |
      Distinctive properties that define tanzanite:

      - **Species**: Zoisite (calcium aluminium silicate)
      - **Colour**: Violet-blue to blue-violet
      - **Pleochroism**: Strong; blue, violet, burgundy axes
      - **Heat treatment**: Nearly universal; improves colour
      - **Hardness**: 6-7 (requires careful setting)
      - **Cleavage**: Perfect in one direction (care needed)

  - title: Colour Grades

      Understanding tanzanite colour quality:
    subsections:
      - title: Exceptional
        content: |
          - Vivid violet-blue colour
          - Strong saturation throughout
          - Medium to medium-dark tone
          - Commands highest prices

      - title: Fine
        content: |
          - Strong blue with violet modifier
          - Attractive, well-saturated colour
          - Good market demand

      - title: Good/Commercial
        content: |
          - Lighter blue-violet
          - Visible colour but less saturated
          - Accessible price points

      - title: Viewing Considerations
        content: |
          - **Direction dependence**: Colour varies significantly with viewing angle
          - **Best face-up**: Cutters orient for optimal blue/violet balance
          - **Lighting**: Appears more violet under incandescent light

  - title: Heat Treatment
    content: |
      Standard enhancement for tanzanite:

      - **Purpose**: Removes brown/yellow component, enhances blue-violet
      - **Prevalence**: Nearly all commercial tanzanite is heated
      - **Detection**: Very difficult; generally assumed
      - **Unheated**: Rare; some collectors seek natural colour
      - **Disclosure**: Treatment generally assumed and accepted

  - title: Single Source Concern
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Geographic Rarity
      text: |
        Tanzanite comes from a single deposit approximately 4km long by 2km wide.
        No other commercial source has been discovered despite extensive prospecting.

        This geographic concentration makes tanzanite supply vulnerable. The deposit
        is expected to be exhausted within decades, making fine stones potentially
        collectible investments.

  - title: Market Position
    content: |
      Tanzanite's place in the gem market:

      - **Tiffany & Co.**: Named the gem and promoted it heavily
      - **December birthstone**: Added in 2002
      - **Price range**: Wide, from affordable to investment grade
      - **Size availability**: Fine large stones increasingly rare
      - **Collector interest**: Growing as supply concerns mount
