      title: Large Stones Exceptional
      text: |
        Tsavorite rarely occurs in large sizes. Stones over 2 carats are uncommon,
        and those over 5 carats are exceptional collector pieces commanding
        significant premiums.

        This size limitation, combined with no known large deposits, keeps
        fine tsavorite among the rarer coloured gemstones.
