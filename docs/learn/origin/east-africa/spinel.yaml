      title: Mahenge vs Burma
      text: |
        Both Mahenge (Tanzania) and Mogok (Burma) produce exceptional pink-red
        spinel from marble host rocks. The similar geology creates comparable
        quality potential.

        Market generally values them similarly when colour and clarity match,
        though Burmese origin carries historical prestige. Mahenge has the
        advantage of fewer ethical sourcing concerns.
