      East Africa has emerged as one of the world's most important coloured gem
      regions, producing unique varieties found nowhere else. Tanzanite, tsavorite,
      and increasingly significant ruby and tourmaline deposits have transformed
      the global gem market.

      Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique each contribute distinctive material.
