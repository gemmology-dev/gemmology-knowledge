  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      East Africa has emerged as one of the world's most important coloured gem
      regions, producing unique varieties found nowhere else. Tanzanite, tsavorite,
      and increasingly significant ruby and tourmaline deposits have transformed
      the global gem market.

      Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique each contribute distinctive material.

      Tanzania's signature gemstone:
    subsections:
      - title: Discovery & Source
        content: |
          - **Discovery**: 1967 by Maasai tribesman
          - **Location**: Merelani Hills, near Mount Kilimanjaro
          - **Exclusivity**: Only known commercial source worldwide
          - **Geology**: Unique conditions in single deposit

      - title: Characteristics
        content: |
          - **Species**: Zoisite (calcium aluminium silicate)
          - **Colour**: Violet-blue to blue-violet
          - **Pleochroism**: Strong; blue, violet, burgundy
          - **Heat treatment**: Nearly universal; improves colour

      - title: Colour Grades
        content: |
          - **Exceptional**: Vivid violet-blue; saturated
          - **Fine**: Strong blue with violet; attractive
          - **Good**: Lighter blue-violet; commercial
          - **Direction dependence**: Colour varies with viewing angle

  - title: Tanzanite Rarity
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Single Source Concern
      text: |
        Tanzanite comes from a single deposit approximately 4km long by 2km wide.
        No other commercial source has been discovered despite extensive prospecting.

        This geographic concentration makes tanzanite supply vulnerable. The deposit
        is expected to be exhausted within decades, making fine stones potentially
        collectible investments.

      title: What Is "Paraíba"?
      text: |
        Debate exists whether "Paraíba" refers only to Brazilian origin or
        can apply to any copper-bearing tourmaline with similar colour.

        LMHC (Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee) allows "Paraíba
        tourmaline" for copper-bearing material regardless of origin,
        but origin disclosure is expected on lab reports.
