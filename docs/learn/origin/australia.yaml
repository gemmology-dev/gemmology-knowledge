  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Australia is a world-leading gem producer, most famous for opal but also
      producing significant sapphire, chrysoprase, and other coloured stones.
      Australian opal accounts for approximately 95% of world production.

      The distinctive characteristics of Australian gems, particularly opal,
      make origin an important value factor.

      title: Value Factor
      text: |
        Opal body tone significantly affects value. The scale runs from N1
        (black) to N9 (white), with darker body tones generally more valuable
        as they provide better contrast for play-of-colour.

        Black opal (N1-N4) commands highest premiums when combined with
        bright, full-spectrum play-of-colour.

    callout:
      type: tip
      title: Australian Specialty
      text: |
        Parti-sapphires (particoloured sapphires) showing distinct colour
        zones are an Australian specialty. These stones display two or more
        colours—typically blue, green, and yellow—in the same stone.

        Once considered undesirable, parti-sapphires now have collector
        following for their unique character. Fine examples show clear,
        distinct colour boundaries.

  - title: Argyle Diamonds
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Historic Source Closed
      text: |
        The Argyle mine in Western Australia was the world's primary source
        of pink diamonds, producing over 90% of global supply. The mine
        closed in November 2020.

        Argyle pink diamonds are now increasingly valuable as a finite
        resource. Provenance documentation adds significant premium.
