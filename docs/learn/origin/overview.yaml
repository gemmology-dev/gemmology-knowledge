      Geographic origin determination identifies the locality where a gemstone formed.
      Origin can significantly affect value, with certain sources commanding substantial
      premiums due to historical significance, quality associations, or rarity.

      Origin is determined through careful analysis of inclusion suites, trace element
      chemistry, and growth characteristics.

        - title: Premium Factors
          points:
            - Historical prestige (Kashmir, Burma, Colombia)
            - Consistent quality association
            - Rarity of production
            - Market perception and demand
            - Collector interest
        - title: Practical Considerations
          points:
            - Treatment likelihood varies by origin
            - Ethical sourcing concerns
            - Investment and resale value
            - Insurance and documentation
            - Trade and customs regulations

    subsections:
      - title: Inclusion Analysis
        content: |
          The primary method for origin determination. Characteristic inclusions form
          fingerprints unique to specific geological environments:

          - **Mineral inclusions**: Identify host rock and formation conditions
          - **Fluid inclusions**: Reveal formation fluids and temperatures
          - **Growth patterns**: Record crystallization history
          - **Solid inclusion assemblages**: Diagnostic for specific localities

      - title: Trace Element Chemistry
        content: |
          Advanced spectroscopic techniques measure trace elements that vary by deposit:

          - **LA-ICP-MS**: Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
          - **LIBS**: Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy
          - **ED-XRF**: Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence

          Ratios of elements like Fe, Ti, Ga, V, and Cr help distinguish origins.

      - title: Spectroscopic Features
        content: |
          - UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra
          - Photoluminescence characteristics
          - Infrared spectroscopy
          - Raman spectroscopy for inclusion identification

        - ["Blue Sapphire", "Burma (Mogok)", "+20-40% vs Ceylon"]
        - ["Ruby", "Burma (Mogok)", "+30-100% vs Mozambique"]
        - ["Emerald", "Colombia", "+20-50% vs Zambia"]
        - ["Paraíba Tourmaline", "Brazil", "+100-300% vs Mozambique"]

      title: Value Depends on Multiple Factors
      text: |
        Origin premiums are highly variable and depend on:

        - Stone quality (colour, clarity, size)
        - Treatment status (unheated commands more premium)
        - Market conditions and demand
        - Individual stone characteristics

        A fine Ceylon sapphire will always be worth more than a poor Kashmir sapphire.
        Origin alone does not guarantee value.

  - title: Report Terminology
    content: |
      Understanding laboratory report language:

      - **"Consistent with..."**: Inclusions match known characteristics
      - **"Origin undeterminable"**: Insufficient diagnostic features
      - **"Heat treatment: None"**: No evidence of heating detected
      - **"Heat treatment: Evidence of..."**: Signs of thermal treatment

  - title: Limitations
    content: |
      Origin determination has inherent limitations:

      - Some deposits produce material with overlapping characteristics
      - Heavily included or treated stones may be difficult to assess
      - New deposits may initially lack reference samples
      - Different labs may reach different conclusions
      - Origin reports represent the laboratory's opinion based on current knowledge
