  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Brazil produces world-class aquamarine and holds exclusive rights to
      imperial topaz. The "Santa Maria" colour designation for finest blue
      aquamarine originated here, and Brazilian material has set quality
      standards for over a century.

      title: The Colour Standard
      text: |
        "Santa Maria" originally described the intense, saturated blue
        aquamarines from Santa Maria de Itabira in Brazil. The term now
        applies to any aquamarine with similar colour intensity, regardless
        of origin.

        True Santa Maria blue is medium to medium-dark, strongly saturated,
        with minimal green modifier. This designation commands premium prices.

      title: Geographic Exclusivity
      text: |
        True imperial topaz comes only from the Ouro Preto region of Brazil.
        While other locations produce orange topaz, none matches the colour
        range and quality of Brazilian imperial topaz.

        This geographic exclusivity, combined with declining production,
        makes fine imperial topaz increasingly valuable.
