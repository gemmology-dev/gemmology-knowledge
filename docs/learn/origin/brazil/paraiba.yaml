  - title: Introduction

      Paraíba tourmaline represents one of the most remarkable gem discoveries
      of the 20th century. The neon blue-green colours, caused by trace copper,
      were unlike anything previously seen in tourmaline and created an entirely
      new category in the gem market.

      title: Brazilian vs African Pricing
      text: |
        Brazilian Paraíba commands significant premium over African material
        despite identical copper chromophore. Fine Brazilian stones may sell
        for 2-5x the price of comparable African material.

        This premium reflects rarity (Brazilian sources nearly exhausted),
        historical significance, and market perception. Both require origin
        disclosure on laboratory reports.

  - title: Treatment Considerations
    content: |
      Enhancement in Paraíba tourmaline:

      - **Heat treatment**: Sometimes used to improve colour
      - **Purpose**: Reduces pink/violet component
      - **Detection**: Can often be identified by laboratories
      - **Disclosure**: Required; affects value
      - **Unheated premium**: Clean unheated stones most valuable

  - title: Collecting Paraíba
    content: |
      Considerations for collectors:

      - **Laboratory reports**: Essential; verify copper presence
      - **Origin determination**: Brazilian origin documented
      - **Treatment status**: Check for heating
      - **Colour quality**: Neon "electric" effect most valued
      - **Investment potential**: Strong for fine Brazilian stones
      - **Matching**: Sets extremely difficult and valuable
