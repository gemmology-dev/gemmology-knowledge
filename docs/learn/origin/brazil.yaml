      title: Geographic Exclusivity
      text: |
        True imperial topaz comes only from the Ouro Preto region of Brazil.
        While other locations produce orange topaz, none matches the colour
        range and quality of Brazilian imperial topaz.

        This geographic exclusivity, combined with declining production,
        makes fine imperial topaz increasingly valuable.
