  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Zambia has become the world's second-largest emerald producer, with the
      Kagem mine being the most significant operation. Zambian emeralds have
      distinct characteristics from Colombian material, often offering better
      clarity at competitive prices.

      The Zambian emerald trade has grown significantly since the 1970s.

      title: Key Distinction from Colombia
      text: |
        Zambian emeralds do NOT contain the three-phase inclusions (liquid +
        gas + halite) diagnostic of Colombian origin. They show two-phase
        inclusions (liquid + gas only).

        This is one of the primary features distinguishing Zambian from
        Colombian emeralds under magnification.
