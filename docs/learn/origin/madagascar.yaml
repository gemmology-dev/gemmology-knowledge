  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Madagascar emerged as a major gem source in the late 20th century, now producing
      significant quantities of sapphire, ruby, and other coloured stones. The island's
      diverse geology yields gems comparable to classic sources.

      Madagascar has become one of the world's most important sapphire producers,
      filling market gaps as traditional sources decline.

      title: Similar to Sri Lanka
      text: |
        Madagascar sapphires often share characteristics with Ceylon material:
        similar colour tones, inclusion types, and appearance. This similarity
        reflects comparable geological conditions.

        Laboratory origin determination can be challenging; some stones show
        overlapping characteristics between the two sources.

      title: Rare Species Source
      text: |
        Madagascar is the world's primary source for gem-quality grandidierite,
        a rare blue-green orthorhombic mineral. First discovered in 1902 but
        only recently available in gem quality.

        This illustrates Madagascar's importance for rare collector gems
        beyond mainstream sapphire and ruby production.
