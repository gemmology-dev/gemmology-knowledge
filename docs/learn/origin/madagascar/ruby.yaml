  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Madagascar ruby production has grown significantly, with deposits at
      Andilamena, Vatomandry, and other locations. While quality varies
      considerably, Madagascar helps fill the gap from declining Burmese
      supply, though treatment disclosure remains an important consideration.

      Madagascar's ruby-producing regions:
    subsections:
      - title: Andilamena
        content: |
          - **Location**: Northern Madagascar
          - **Status**: Primary ruby region
          - **Character**: Variable quality production
          - **History**: Major discovery area

      - title: Vatomandry
        content: |
          - **Location**: Eastern Madagascar
          - **Production**: Secondary ruby source
          - **Character**: Different inclusion characteristics

      - title: Other Deposits
        content: |
          - Multiple smaller deposits across island
          - Continuing exploration and discoveries
          - Various qualities and characteristics

  - title: Characteristics
    content: |
      Madagascar ruby properties:
    subsections:
      - title: Colour
        content: |
          - **Range**: Variable; some fine red
          - **Best material**: Good saturation possible
          - **Common**: Medium quality commercial material
          - **Character**: Can compete with traditional sources

      - title: Clarity
        content: |
          - Variable across production
          - Clean stones available
          - Some silky material
          - Typical corundum inclusions

      - title: Fluorescence
        content: |
          - Variable depending on iron content
          - Lower iron = better fluorescence
          - Less consistent than Mogok
          - Factor in colour appearance

  - title: Treatment Considerations
    content: |
      Understanding treatment in Madagascar ruby:
    subsections:
      - title: Heat Treatment
        content: |
          - Low-temperature heating common
          - Improves colour and clarity
          - Generally accepted if disclosed
          - Unheated fine stones command premium

      - title: Beryllium Diffusion
        callout:
          type: warning
          title: Important Disclosure Issue
          text: |
            Some Madagascar ruby has been treated with beryllium diffusion,
            which uses trace elements to alter colour throughout the stone.
            This treatment is controversial and must be disclosed.

            Laboratory testing is essential for significant purchases to
            detect beryllium treatment. Always request certification.

      - title: Disclosure Requirements
        content: |
          - All treatments must be disclosed
          - Beryllium diffusion particularly important
          - Laboratory reports recommended
          - Unheated premium significant

  - title: Market Position
    content: |

          - Wide range of price points

      - title: Comparison
        content: |
          - Below Burmese for comparable quality
          - Competitive with Mozambique
          - Treatment history affects value
          - Origin becoming more accepted

  - title: Buying Considerations
    content: |
      What to consider when purchasing:

      - **Laboratory reports**: Essential for significant purchases
      - **Treatment disclosure**: Verify what treatments applied
      - **Beryllium testing**: Request specific testing
      - **Unheated premium**: Worth paying for fine stones
      - **Origin verification**: Laboratory confirmation available
