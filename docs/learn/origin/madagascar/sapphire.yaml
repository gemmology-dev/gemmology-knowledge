  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Madagascar sapphire, primarily from the Ilakaka region discovered in 1998,
      has become one of the world's most significant sapphire sources. The material
      often shows characteristics similar to Ceylon sapphire, providing excellent
      quality at competitive prices.

      title: Similar to Sri Lanka
      text: |
        Madagascar sapphires often share characteristics with Ceylon material:
        similar colour tones, inclusion types, and appearance. This similarity
        reflects comparable geological conditions.

        Laboratory origin determination can be challenging; some stones show
        overlapping characteristics between the two sources.
