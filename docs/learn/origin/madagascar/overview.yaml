      Madagascar emerged as a major gem source in the late 20th century, now producing
      significant quantities of sapphire, ruby, and other coloured stones. The island's
      diverse geology yields gems comparable to classic sources.

      Madagascar has become one of the world's most important sapphire producers,
      filling market gaps as traditional sources decline.
