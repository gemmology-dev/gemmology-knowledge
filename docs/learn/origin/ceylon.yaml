      title: Ceylon's Signature
      text: |
        Ceylon sapphires are known for their long, slender rutile silk—
        in contrast to the short silk typical of Burmese material.

        This long silk is one of the primary features used to identify
        Ceylon origin. It can create a soft appearance when present but
        doesn't produce the Kashmir velvety effect.
