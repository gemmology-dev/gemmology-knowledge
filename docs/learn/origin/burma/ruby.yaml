  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Burmese ruby, particularly from the Mogok Stone Tract, represents the
      world standard for ruby quality. The term "pigeon blood" was coined to
      describe the ideal Mogok colour, and this origin commands the highest
      premiums in the ruby market.

    subsections:
      - title: What Makes Mogok Special
        content: |
          - **Geology**: Marble host rock (low iron environment)
          - **Colour**: Pure chromium red with minimal iron
          - **Fluorescence**: Strong red (adds to colour)
          - **Clarity**: Often clean or with silk that adds softness
          - **History**: 1,000+ years of documented production

      - title: The Pigeon Blood Colour
        content: |
          - **Ideal**: Vivid red with slight blue modifier
          - **Tone**: Medium to medium-dark
          - **Saturation**: High without appearing dark
          - **Fluorescence**: Strong red glow in daylight
          - **Effect**: Seems to glow from within

      title: The Ideal Colour
      text: |
        "Pigeon blood" describes the ideal ruby colour: vivid red with a slight
        blue modifier, medium-dark tone, and strong saturation. The term
        originally applied only to Mogok rubies.

        Today, major laboratories have their own criteria - some will apply the
        term to exceptional rubies regardless of origin. The designation
        adds significant value when certified.

      rows:
        - ["Short rutile silk", "Fine, short needles (may dissolve if heated)"]
        - ["Calcite crystite", "Rhombohedral; may be dissolved"]
        - ["Apatite", "Hexagonal prisms"]

        - ["Fingerprints", "Healed fractures"]

  - title: Mong Hsu Ruby
    content: |
      Myanmar's other major ruby source:

      - **Location**: Shan State, discovered 1990s
      - **Character**: Often dark cores with saturated edges
      - **Treatment**: Most material heat-treated
      - **Volume**: Major production; lower quality average
      - **Value**: Less than Mogok for comparable quality
      - **Identification**: Dark core often visible even after heating

  - title: Treatment Considerations

      Understanding treatment in Burmese ruby:
    subsections:
      - title: Heat Treatment
        content: |
          - Common, especially for Mong Hsu material
          - Dissolves silk, improves colour
          - Accepted if disclosed
          - Unheated Mogok commands significant premium

      - title: Unheated Premium
        content: |
          - Unheated fine Mogok ruby: highest values
          - Laboratory certification essential
          - Premium can exceed 50-100%+ over heated
          - Increasingly rare in fine quality

      Regional ruby characteristics differ:
    subsections:
      - title: Thai/Cambodian Character
        content: |
          - **Darker tone**: Often darker than Burmese
          - **Brownish modifier**: Higher iron content
          - **Less fluorescence**: Iron quenches fluorescence
          - **Dense silk**: Extensive rutile networks

        - ["Silk", "Short, may dissolve", "Dense networks"]
        - ["Premium", "Highest", "Lower"]

  - title: Market Position
