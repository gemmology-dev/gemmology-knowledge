    content: |
      Myanmar (Burma) produces some of the world's finest gems, particularly ruby.
      The Mogok Stone Tract has been mined for over 1,000 years and remains the
      benchmark for ruby quality. "Pigeon blood" originally described only Mogok
      rubies.

      Beyond ruby, Burma produces exceptional sapphires, spinels, and jadeite.
