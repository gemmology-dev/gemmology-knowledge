  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Australia has been a significant sapphire producer since the 1850s,
      with major alluvial deposits in New South Wales and Queensland.
      While often darker than Ceylon or Burmese material, Australian
      sapphires offer excellent value and distinctive parti-colour varieties.

      title: Australian Signature
      text: |
        Parti-sapphires (particoloured sapphires) showing distinct colour
        zones are an Australian specialty. These stones display two or more
        colours - typically blue, green, and yellow - in the same stone.

        Once considered undesirable, parti-sapphires now have collector
        following for their unique character. Fine examples show clear,
        distinct colour boundaries.
