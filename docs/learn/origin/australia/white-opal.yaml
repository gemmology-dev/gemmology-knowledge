      White opal represents the majority of Australian opal production,
      with Coober Pedy in South Australia being the largest opal mining
      area in the world. While less valuable than black opal, fine white
      and crystal opal display beautiful play-of-colour at accessible prices.

    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Composite Opals
      text: |
        Much commercial "opal" jewellery contains doublets (opal slice on backing)
        or triplets (doublet with clear cap). These use thin slices of opal
        to create affordable jewellery.

        Always verify whether opal is solid, doublet, or triplet. Solid opal
        commands significant premium over composite materials.
