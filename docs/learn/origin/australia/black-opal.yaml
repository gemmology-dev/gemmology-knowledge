      title: Value Factor
      text: |
        Opal body tone significantly affects value. The scale runs from N1
        (black) to N9 (white), with darker body tones generally more valuable
        as they provide better contrast for play-of-colour.

        Black opal (N1-N4) commands highest premiums when combined with
        bright, full-spectrum play-of-colour.
