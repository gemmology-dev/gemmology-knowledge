  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Myanmar (Burma) produces some of the world's finest gems, particularly ruby.
      The Mogok Stone Tract has been mined for over 1,000 years and remains the
      benchmark for ruby quality. "Pigeon blood" originally described only Mogok
      rubies.

      Beyond ruby, Burma produces exceptional sapphires, spinels, and jadeite.

  - title: Mogok Ruby
    content: |
      Mogok produces the world's finest rubies:
    subsections:
      - title: Pigeon Blood Colour
        content: |
          - **Ideal**: Vivid red with slight blue modifier
          - **Tone**: Medium to medium-dark
          - **Saturation**: High without appearing dark
          - **Fluorescence**: Strong red (low iron content)
          - **Effect**: Glows in daylight

      - title: Why Mogok Excels
        content: |
          - Marble host rock (low iron environment)
          - Pure chromium colour with minimal iron
          - Strong fluorescence adds to colour
          - Often clean or with silk that adds softness

  - title: Pigeon Blood Term

      title: The Ideal Colour
      text: |
        "Pigeon blood" describes the ideal ruby colour: vivid red with a slight
        blue modifier, medium-dark tone, and strong saturation. The term
        originally applied only to Mogok rubies.

        Today, major laboratories have their own criteria—some will apply the
        term to exceptional rubies regardless of origin. The designation
        adds significant value when certified.
