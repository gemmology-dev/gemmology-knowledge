      All crystals belong to one of seven crystal systems, classified by their unit cell
      geometry and symmetry elements. Understanding these systems is fundamental to
      crystallography and gem identification.

      Crystal systems are defined by the relationship between crystallographic axes
      (a, b, c) and the angles between them (α, β, γ). Each system has characteristic
      symmetry elements that determine possible crystal forms.

  - title: Identifying Crystal Systems
    content: |
      When examining a crystal or gemstone, you can often determine its crystal system
      by observing:

      - **Crystal habit** - The external shape and face arrangement
      - **Optic character** - Isotropic (cubic) vs. uniaxial vs. biaxial
      - **Interference figure** - Under polarized light microscopy
      - **Cleavage directions** - Related to internal symmetry
