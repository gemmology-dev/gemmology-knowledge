      Inclusions are internal features that provide valuable information about a gem's
      identity, origin, and natural vs. synthetic status. They are a gem's "fingerprint."

            - Common Solid Inclusions
          rows:
            - ["Ruby/Sapphire", "Rutile silk, zircon halos, calcite, apatite"]

            - ["Garnet", "Rutile, apatite, rounded crystals"]

      - title: Fluid Inclusions
        content: |
          Trapped liquids, often with gas bubbles:

          - **Two-phase** - Liquid + gas bubble
          - **Three-phase** - Liquid + gas + solid crystal (diagnostic for Colombian emerald)
          - **Fingerprint inclusions** - Healed fractures with fluid remnants
          - **Negative crystals** - Fluid-filled cavities with crystal shape

      - title: Growth Features
        content: |
          Patterns formed during crystallization:

          - **Colour zoning** - Bands of different colour intensity
          - **Growth tubes** - Hollow channels parallel to c-axis
          - **Twinning** - Internal reflection planes
          - **Phantoms** - Earlier growth stages visible inside

  - title: Microscopy Techniques
    content: |
      Different lighting techniques reveal different inclusion types:

      - **Darkfield** - Best for seeing inclusions against dark background
      - **Brightfield** - Good for colour zoning and growth patterns
      - **Fibre-optic** - Pinpoint light for specific features
      - **Immersion** - Reduces surface reflections, reveals internal features
      - **Polarized light** - Shows strain patterns and twinning

      title: Best Practice
      text: |
        Always examine gems under magnification (10x minimum, 40-60x preferred)
        using multiple lighting techniques. Document findings with photographs
        when possible for comparison and records.
