  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Laboratory reports provide independent verification of a gemstone's identity,
      natural or synthetic origin, treatments, and sometimes geographic origin.
      Understanding lab reports is essential for trade and high-value purchases.

      Different laboratories have varying strengths, methodologies, and market
      recognition. Report quality directly affects gem value and confidence.

  - title: Purpose of Lab Reports
    content: |
      Why laboratory certification matters:
    subsections:
      - title: What Labs Verify
        content: |
          - **Species identification**: Confirms what the gem actually is
          - **Natural vs synthetic**: Distinguishes natural from lab-grown
          - **Treatment status**: Discloses any enhancements
          - **Origin determination**: Geographic source (advanced analysis)
          - **Quality grades**: Some labs grade colour, clarity, cut

      - title: When Reports Are Essential
        content: |
          - High-value coloured stones (typically >$5,000)
          - Claimed premium origins (Kashmir, Burma, Colombia)
          - Claimed untreated status for ruby, sapphire, emerald
          - Any stone where authenticity affects value significantly
          - Auction and estate sales

      title: Always Verify Reports
      text: |
        Counterfeit reports exist. Always verify reports directly with the
        issuing laboratory before purchase:

        - Use the lab's online verification system
        - Check report number, date, weight match
        - Verify stone appearance matches description
        - For high-value stones, consider re-certification

        Reputable labs offer online verification tools using report numbers.

      title: Colour Grades Add Value
      text: |
        GRS colour grades like "pigeon blood" and "royal blue" add significant
        market value, particularly in Asian markets. These grades have specific
        criteria related to hue, tone, saturation, and fluorescence.

        Not all fine rubies or sapphires qualify. The designation appears on
        the report only when criteria are met.

  - title: Reading a Report
    content: |
      Practical interpretation guide:
    subsections:
      - title: Key Questions to Answer
        content: |
          - Is the stone natural or synthetic?

          - Is origin claimed and well-supported?
          - Does the weight match the actual stone?
          - Is the report number verifiable?

      - title: Red Flags
        content: |
          - Origin claimed without clear supporting evidence
          - Unclear treatment status or evasive language
          - Report from unknown or unaccredited lab
          - Discrepancies between report and stone
          - Report number fails online verification

      - title: Best Practices
        content: |
          - Match report to actual stone carefully
          - Verify report online before purchase
          - Understand what the lab does and doesn't claim
          - For very high values, consider second opinion
          - Keep original reports secure; copies for display

  - title: Cost Considerations
    content: |
      Laboratory report costs and timing:

      - **Basic identification**: $50-150
      - **Full report with origin**: $100-500+
      - **Rush services**: Additional premium
      - **Turnaround**: Days to weeks depending on lab/service
      - **Value threshold**: Reports typically worthwhile >$1,000 stones
