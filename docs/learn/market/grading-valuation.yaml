  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Grading coloured gemstones is more complex than grading diamonds because there is no
      universal standard system. The "4 Cs" (Colour, Clarity, Cut, Carat weight) apply, but
      colour is overwhelmingly the most important factor—often accounting for 50-70% of
      a coloured stone's value.

      Professional grading requires controlled lighting conditions, master stones for
      comparison (where available), and extensive experience with each gem species.

  - title: Colour Grading
    content: |
      Colour is described using three components: hue, tone, and saturation. Understanding
      these components is essential for accurate colour communication and grading.
    subsections:
      - title: Hue
        content: |
          Hue is the basic spectral colour (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) or a
          combination of adjacent hues. In grading, hue is described by:

          - **Primary hue**: The dominant colour seen
          - **Secondary hue**: Modifying colour (e.g., "slightly purplish red")
          - **Tertiary modifiers**: Subtle additional colours in complex stones

          A pure, unmodified hue is generally most desirable for the "big three" gems.

      - title: Tone
        content: |
          Tone describes the lightness or darkness of a colour on a scale from colourless
          (0) to black (10). Ideal tones vary by species:

          - **Very light (2-3)**: Often too pale, lacks presence
          - **Light (3-4)**: Acceptable for some species (aquamarine)
          - **Medium (5-6)**: Often ideal for most coloured gems
          - **Medium-dark (6-7)**: Can be excellent if saturation is maintained
          - **Dark (7-8)**: May appear blackish, lose colour visibility
          - **Very dark (8-9)**: Generally too dark, colour not visible

      - title: Saturation
        content: |
          Saturation describes the intensity or purity of the colour, from grey (low
          saturation) to vivid (high saturation). Saturation is the key differentiator
          between fine and commercial goods.

          - **Greyish**: Low saturation, washed out
          - **Slightly greyish**: Moderate saturation
          - **Moderately strong**: Good saturation
          - **Strong**: High saturation
          - **Vivid**: Maximum saturation (most valuable)

  - title: Colour Grading Conditions
    callout:
      type: tip
      title: Standardised Lighting
      text: |
        Professional colour grading should be performed under:

        - **D65 daylight equivalent** lighting (6500K colour temperature)
        - **Neutral grey** background
        - **North-facing window** light (natural daylight) or calibrated lamps
        - **Consistent viewing distance** and angle

        Grading in incandescent light will make stones appear more red/orange; fluorescent
        lighting can emphasise blue/green. Always note lighting conditions in any assessment.

  - title: Clarity Grading
    content: |
      Unlike diamonds, coloured gemstones have no universal clarity grading system. The GIA
      developed a clarity type system that sets expectations based on how each species
      typically forms.
    subsections:
      - title: GIA Clarity Types
        table:
          headers:
            - Type
            - Description
            - Examples
          rows:
            - ["Type I", "Usually eye-clean", "Aquamarine, topaz, tanzanite, citrine"]
            - ["Type II", "Usually included", "Ruby, sapphire, garnet, spinel, peridot"]
            - ["Type III", "Almost always included", "Emerald, red tourmaline, alexandrite"]

      - title: Clarity Terminology
        content: |
          Common clarity descriptors for coloured stones:

          - **Loupe-clean**: No inclusions visible under 10× magnification
          - **Eye-clean**: No inclusions visible to naked eye (most common standard)
          - **Slightly included**: Minor inclusions visible to naked eye
          - **Moderately included**: Noticeable inclusions but acceptable
          - **Heavily included**: Significant inclusions affecting beauty or durability

      - title: Clarity Factors
        content: |
          When assessing clarity impact, consider:

          - **Size**: Larger inclusions have more impact
          - **Number**: Many small inclusions can be worse than one large one
          - **Position**: Central inclusions more distracting than peripheral
          - **Relief**: High-contrast inclusions more visible
          - **Nature**: Some inclusions affect durability (fractures, cleavages)

  - title: Emerald Clarity Exception
    callout:
      type: info
      title: Emerald Clarity Standards
      text: |
        Emerald is the only major gemstone where visible inclusions are widely accepted.
        The French term "jardin" (garden) describes the internal world of inclusions.
        Eye-clean emeralds are extremely rare and command extraordinary premiums.

        A slightly included emerald with excellent colour will typically outvalue a clean
        emerald with poor colour.

  - title: Cut Quality Assessment
    content: |
      Cut quality affects brilliance, colour display, and face-up appearance. Unlike diamonds,
      coloured stone cutting prioritises colour retention and window avoidance over strict
      proportions.
    subsections:
      - title: Proportions
        content: |
          Key proportion factors:

          - **Crown height**: Affects brilliance and colour modification
          - **Pavilion depth**: Critical for light return and colour
          - **Table size**: Affects brilliance vs. colour depth
          - **Length-to-width ratio**: Personal preference; affects face-up size
          - **Symmetry**: Facet alignment and overall balance

      - title: Common Cut Problems
        table:
          headers:
            - Problem
            - Cause
            - Effect
          rows:
            - ["Windowing", "Pavilion too shallow", "See-through area in centre"]
            - ["Extinction", "Pavilion too deep", "Dark, lifeless areas"]
            - ["Bowtie", "Poor symmetry in ovals/marquises", "Dark band across stone"]
            - ["Fish-eye", "Crown too shallow", "Ring visible in table"]
            - ["Off-centre culet", "Asymmetric cutting", "Uneven light return"]

      - title: Native Cut vs Precision Cut
        content: |
          - **Native cut**: Cut at origin to maximise weight; often has windows/extinction
          - **Precision cut**: Cut to ideal proportions; sacrifices weight for beauty
          - **Recut potential**: Native cuts may be improved by recutting (with weight loss)

  - title: Weight Retention
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Weight vs Beauty Trade-off
      text: |
        Most coloured stones are cut to retain maximum weight rather than optimise beauty.
        Rough gemstones are priced per carat, incentivising cutters to keep weight even at
        the expense of brilliance. Precision-cut stones typically show 20-30% more brilliance
        but sacrifice 20-40% of potential weight.

  - title: Face-Up Appearance
    content: |
      The most important assessment is how the stone looks face-up (table facing viewer).
      This evaluates:
    subsections:
      - title: Brilliance
        content: |
          The amount of light returned to the viewer. Well-cut stones show bright flashes
          across the face; poorly cut stones have dark or see-through areas.

      - title: Colour Distribution
        content: |
          How evenly colour is distributed across the face. Zoning (colour concentrated in
          areas) is common but reduces value if visible face-up.

      - title: Scintillation
        content: |
          The pattern of light and dark areas when the stone moves. Pleasing scintillation
          shows balanced, lively movement; poor scintillation appears static or blotchy.

  - title: Carat Weight
    content: |
      Weight is measured in carats (1 carat = 0.200 grams). Price per carat typically
      increases at certain weight thresholds.
    subsections:
      - title: Weight-Size Relationship
        content: |
          Different specific gravities mean equal weights look different sizes:

          - **Low SG** (opal 2.15): Looks larger for same weight
          - **Medium SG** (quartz 2.65): Standard reference
          - **High SG** (zircon 4.69): Looks smaller for same weight

          A 1-carat opal appears larger than a 1-carat diamond; a 1-carat zircon appears
          smaller.

      - title: Price Jumps
        content: |
          Prices per carat often jump at key thresholds:

          - **1 carat**: First major threshold
          - **2 carats**: Significant premium
          - **3 carats**: Begins "important stone" territory
          - **5 carats**: Rare size for most gems
          - **10+ carats**: Exceptional; auction-level

          A 0.99 ct stone may cost significantly less than a 1.01 ct stone of equal quality.

  - title: Additional Value Factors
    content: |
      Beyond the basic quality factors, several other elements affect coloured gemstone value.
    subsections:
      - title: Treatment Status
        content: |
          Untreated stones command premiums over treated equivalents:

          - **No heat** (ruby, sapphire): 20-50%+ premium over heated
          - **No oil** (emerald): 30-100%+ premium over oiled
          - **No treatment**: Maximum premium for fine quality

          Treatment must always be disclosed; undisclosed treatment is fraud.

      - title: Origin
        content: |
          Geographic origin affects value through:

          - **Historical prestige**: Kashmir, Burma, Colombia
          - **Quality association**: Certain origins produce consistently finer goods
          - **Rarity**: Some deposits are exhausted or limited

          See Origin Determination for detailed premiums.

      - title: Certification
        content: |
          Laboratory reports from recognised labs add value by:

          - Confirming identity and natural status
          - Documenting treatments (or lack thereof)
          - Providing origin determination
          - Establishing provenance for insurance/resale

          Major labs: GIA, Gübelin, SSEF, AGL, GRS

      - title: Provenance
        content: |
          Historical ownership can significantly increase value:

          - Royal or noble ownership
          - Celebrity provenance
          - Historical significance
          - Previous auction records

      title: Grading Best Practices
      text: |
        1. **Assess colour first**: It dominates value; don't be distracted by clarity
        2. **Use standardised lighting**: D65 daylight equivalent
        3. **Compare to master stones**: When available for the species
        4. **Document systematically**: Same format for every stone
        5. **Consider market context**: Grading relates to value; understand the market
        6. **Acknowledge limitations**: Grading is subjective; state assumptions
        7. **Request lab reports**: For significant purchases
