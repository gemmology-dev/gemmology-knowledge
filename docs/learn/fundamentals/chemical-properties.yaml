  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Understanding gem chemistry explains why gems have their colours, what makes
      one variety of a species different from another, and how treatments work.
      Chemical composition determines many physical and optical properties.

      The study of chromophores (colour-causing agents) is particularly important
      for gem identification, treatment detection, and understanding colour stability.

  - title: Allochromatic vs Idiochromatic Minerals
    content: |
      Minerals are classified by how they obtain their colour.
    comparison:
      items:
        - title: Allochromatic (Other-Coloured)
          points:
            - Colour from trace impurities
            - Pure form is colourless
            - Same mineral can be many colours
            - Impurity not part of ideal formula
            - "Examples: corundum, beryl, quartz"
        - title: Idiochromatic (Self-Coloured)
          points:
            - Colour from essential elements
            - Colour intrinsic to formula
            - Always the same general colour
            - Colour-causing element required
            - "Examples: peridot (Fe), malachite (Cu)"

  - title: Transition Metal Chromophores
    content: |
      Transition metals are the primary colour-causing agents in gems. Their partially
      filled d-orbitals can absorb specific wavelengths of light.
    subsections:
      - title: Chromium (Cr³⁺)
        content: |
          Chromium is responsible for some of the most prized gem colours:

          - **Ruby**: Red corundum (Cr in Al₂O₃)
          - **Emerald**: Green beryl (Cr in Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈)
          - **Alexandrite**: Colour-change chrysoberyl
          - **Red spinel**: Cr-coloured MgAl₂O₄
          - **Chrome tourmaline**: Green tourmaline
          - **Tsavorite**: Green grossular garnet

          Chromium typically produces red in oxide minerals and green in silicates,
          though the host mineral structure affects the exact colour.

      - title: Iron (Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺)
        content: |
          Iron is the most common colouring agent in gems:

          - **Fe²⁺**: Blue-green colours (aquamarine, blue tourmaline)
          - **Fe³⁺**: Yellow-brown colours (citrine, yellow sapphire)
          - **Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ combination**: Can produce various colours

          Iron content often affects other properties:
          - Quenches fluorescence (Thai ruby vs Burmese ruby)
          - Affects response to heat treatment
          - Can be modified by HPHT treatment

  - title: Charge Transfer Mechanisms
    content: |
      Some colours result from electron transfer between adjacent ions rather than
      absorption by a single ion.
    subsections:
      - title: Fe²⁺ → Ti⁴⁺ Intervalence Charge Transfer
        content: |
          The classic example of charge transfer colours blue sapphire:

          - Electron transfers from Fe²⁺ to Ti⁴⁺
          - Absorbs red/yellow light → appears blue
          - Requires both iron and titanium present
          - Neither alone would produce blue

          This mechanism explains why blue sapphire shows characteristic three-band
          absorption spectrum at 450, 460, 470 nm.

      - title: Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ Intervalence Charge Transfer
        content: |
          Iron-iron charge transfer affects colour in several gems:

          - Contributes to blue in some sapphires
          - Affects colour in aquamarine
          - Can create greenish-blue tints

      - title: Other Charge Transfer
        content: |
          - **O²⁻ → Fe³⁺**: Contributes to yellow in some minerals
          - **O²⁻ → Cr⁶⁺**: Yellow (chromate compounds)

          Charge transfer absorptions are typically broad bands rather than sharp
          lines in the absorption spectrum.

  - title: Colour Centres
    content: |
      Colour centres are crystal defects that can absorb light. They can be created
      or destroyed by radiation and heating.
    subsections:
      - title: Types of Colour Centres
        content: |
          - **F-centres**: Electron trapped at anion vacancy (Farbzentrum = colour centre)
          - **H-centres**: Hole trapped at cation site
          - **Electron-hole pairs**: Various defect combinations

          Colour centres are responsible for:
          - Smoky quartz (irradiated rock crystal)
          - Blue topaz (irradiated colourless topaz)
          - Some fancy colour diamonds

      - title: Radiation-Induced Colour
        table:
          headers:
            - Starting Material
            - Treatment
            - Result
            - Stability
          rows:
            - ["Colourless quartz", "Gamma irradiation", "Smoky quartz", "Stable"]
            - ["Colourless topaz", "Irradiation + heat", "Blue topaz", "Stable"]
            - ["Colourless beryl", "Irradiation", "Yellow (Maxixe)", "Fades in light"]
            - ["Diamond", "Irradiation", "Green/blue surface", "Permanent"]
            - ["Pearl", "Gamma irradiation", "Grey/black", "Stable"]

      - title: Colour Centre Stability
        content: |
          Colour centre stability varies:

          - **Stable**: Smoky quartz, treated blue topaz
          - **Unstable**: Maxixe beryl (fades in light), some kunzite
          - **Heat-sensitive**: Many can be bleached by heating

          Understanding stability is important for predicting colour permanence.

  - title: Trace Element Effects
    content: |
      Minor and trace elements significantly affect gem properties beyond colour.
    subsections:
      - title: Property Modifications
        content: |
          Trace elements can affect:

          - **Fluorescence**: Cr activates; Fe quenches
          - **Hardness**: Some substitutions affect durability
          - **Specific gravity**: Heavier elements increase SG
          - **Refractive index**: Affects RI slightly
          - **Treatment response**: Determines if treatment works

      - title: Origin Indicators
        content: |
          Trace element ratios can indicate geographic origin:

          - **Ga/Fe ratio**: Distinguishes some sapphire origins
          - **Cr/V ratio**: Helps with emerald origin
          - **Cu concentration**: Paraíba tourmaline identification
          - **Li content**: Can distinguish some deposits

          Advanced testing (LA-ICP-MS, LIBS) measures trace elements for origin
          determination.

      title: Why Chemistry Matters
      text: |
        Understanding gem chemistry helps with:

        1. **Colour prediction**: Know what causes colour
        2. **Treatment understanding**: Why treatments work
        3. **Stability assessment**: Will colour fade?
        4. **Origin clues**: Trace elements indicate source
        5. **Quality factors**: Why some colours are better
        6. **Spectroscopy interpretation**: Connect spectra to chemistry

        Chemistry forms the foundation for advanced gemmological understanding.
