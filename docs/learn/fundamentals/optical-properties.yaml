  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Optical properties are the most important diagnostic features for gem identification.
      The refractometer, polariscope, and dichroscope are essential tools for measuring
      these properties.

  - title: Refractive Index (RI)
    content: |
      The refractive index measures how much light slows down when entering a gemstone.
      It's calculated as the ratio of light speed in vacuum to speed in the material.

      A standard gemmological refractometer can measure RI values from approximately
      1.35 to 1.81 (limited by the contact liquid). Gems with higher RI require
      alternative methods.
    table:
      caption: RI Values by Gemstone
      headers:
        - Gemstone
        - RI Range
        - Optic Character
      rows:
        - ["Diamond", "2.417", "Isotropic"]
        - ["Corundum", "1.762-1.770", "Uniaxial -"]
        - ["Spinel", "1.712-1.736", "Isotropic"]
        - ["Tourmaline", "1.624-1.644", "Uniaxial -"]
        - ["Topaz", "1.609-1.617", "Biaxial +"]
        - ["Quartz", "1.544-1.553", "Uniaxial +"]
        - ["Beryl", "1.570-1.590", "Uniaxial -"]

  - title: Birefringence
    content: |
      Birefringence is the difference between maximum and minimum RI values in
      anisotropic (non-cubic) crystals. Light entering the stone splits into two
      rays traveling at different speeds.

      **Formula:** `Birefringence = RI(max) - RI(min)`

      **Example (Quartz):** `1.553 - 1.544 = 0.009`
    table:

      headers:
        - Birefringence
        - Gemstones
      rows:
        - ["None (0.000)", "Diamond, Spinel, Garnet (isotropic)"]
        - ["Low (0.004-0.010)", "Quartz (0.009), Beryl (0.006)"]
        - ["Medium (0.010-0.020)", "Topaz (0.010), Tourmaline (0.018)"]
        - ["High (0.020-0.050)", "Peridot (0.036), Zircon (0.059)"]
        - ["Very High (>0.050)", "Calcite (0.172), Sphene (0.134)"]

      title: Doubling Effect
      text: |
        High birefringence causes visible "doubling" of back facet edges when viewed
        through the table. This is diagnostic for zircon, sphene, and peridot.

  - title: Optic Character and Sign
    content: |
      The polariscope and conoscope reveal a gem's optic character.
    table:
      headers:
        - Character
        - Crystal Systems
        - RI Values
      rows:
        - ["Isotropic", "Cubic", "Single RI (n)"]
        - ["Uniaxial", "Hexagonal, Trigonal, Tetragonal", "Two values (ω, ε)"]
        - ["Biaxial", "Orthorhombic, Monoclinic, Triclinic", "Three values (α, β, γ)"]
    subsections:
      - title: Optic Sign
        content: |
          - **Uniaxial +**: ε > ω (quartz, zircon)
          - **Uniaxial -**: ε < ω (corundum, tourmaline, beryl)
          - **Biaxial +**: β closer to α (topaz)
          - **Biaxial -**: β closer to γ (peridot)

  - title: Pleochroism
    content: |
      Pleochroism is the absorption of different colours in different crystal directions.
      Viewed with a dichroscope, anisotropic coloured gems show different colours.
    table:
      headers:
        - Gemstone
        - Pleochroism
        - Colours
      rows:
        - ["Ruby", "Strong", "Purple-red / Orange-red"]
        - ["Sapphire (blue)", "Strong", "Violet-blue / Green-blue"]
        - ["Tourmaline", "Strong", "Variable (often dark/light)"]
        - ["Tanzanite", "Strong (trichroic)", "Blue / Purple / Bronze"]
        - ["Peridot", "Weak", "Yellow-green / Green"]
        - ["Aquamarine", "Weak", "Near colourless / Blue"]

  - title: Dispersion
    content: |
      Dispersion is the separation of white light into spectral colours ("fire").
      It's measured as the difference in RI between red (B) and violet (G) wavelengths.
    table:
      headers:
        - Gemstone
        - Dispersion (B-G)
        - Fire Quality
      rows:
        - ["Diamond", "0.044", "Strong"]
        - ["Sphene", "0.051", "Very strong"]
        - ["Demantoid garnet", "0.057", "Very strong"]
        - ["Zircon", "0.039", "Strong"]
        - ["Spinel", "0.020", "Moderate"]
        - ["Quartz", "0.013", "Low"]

  - title: Absorption Spectrum
    content: |
      The absorption spectrum shows which wavelengths of light are absorbed by a gem.
      Viewed through a spectroscope, absorption bands appear as dark lines or bands.

      **Diagnostic Spectra:**
      - **Ruby**: Lines at 694nm (doublet), 668nm, 659nm
      - **Emerald**: Line at 683nm (Cr), bands in red/yellow
      - **Blue sapphire**: Bands at 450nm, 460nm, 470nm
      - **Almandine garnet**: Bands at 505nm, 520nm, 575nm
      - **Zircon**: Fine lines throughout spectrum (uranium)
