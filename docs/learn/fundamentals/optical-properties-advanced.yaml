  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Advanced optical properties go beyond basic RI and birefringence measurements to
      provide detailed information about crystal orientation, optic character, and
      diagnostic spectroscopic features.

      These techniques are essential for accurate gem identification, particularly when
      standard tests give ambiguous results or when working with unusual specimens.

  - title: Interference Figures
    content: |
      Interference figures are observed using a polariscope with a conoscope (converging
      lens) or equivalent setup. They reveal the optic character and sign of anisotropic
      gems.
    subsections:
      - title: How to Obtain Interference Figures
        content: |
          1. Place gem between crossed polars (dark position)
          2. Insert conoscope lens (or use high magnification)
          3. View the interference figure in the gem
          4. Rotate gem to find clearest figure (viewing down optic axis)

          Best results require:
          - Clean, well-polished stone
          - Reasonably transparent material
          - Appropriate viewing direction relative to optic axis

      - title: Uniaxial Interference Figures
        content: |
          Uniaxial crystals (hexagonal, trigonal, tetragonal) have one optic axis.
          When viewed down the optic axis, they show the "bull's eye" pattern:

          - **Concentric isochromatic rings**: Circles of colour
          - **Black cross (isogyres)**: Arms parallel to polariser directions
          - **Melatope**: Central dark point (exit point of optic axis)

          As the stone rotates off the optic axis, the cross moves outward but
          remains visible in the field of view.

      - title: Biaxial Interference Figures
        content: |
          Biaxial crystals (orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic) have two optic axes.
          Viewed down the acute bisectrix, they show:

          - **Two melatopes**: Emerging points of optic axes
          - **Curved isogyres**: Dark bands that change shape with rotation
          - **2V angle**: Angle between optic axes (diagnostic)

          When rotating the stone 45°:
          - Small 2V: Isogyres stay close, barely separate
          - Large 2V: Isogyres separate widely, may leave field of view

  - title: Interference Figure Patterns
    table:
      caption: Interference Figure Characteristics
      headers:
        - Character
        - Down Optic Axis
        - Off-Axis
      rows:
        - ["Uniaxial", "Bull's eye with centred cross", "Cross moves but remains intact"]
        - ["Biaxial (small 2V)", "Fuzzy cross, may look uniaxial", "Cross splits into two curved bars"]
        - ["Biaxial (large 2V)", "Curved bars, two melatopes visible", "Bars separate widely"]
        - ["Isotropic", "No figure; remains dark", "Remains dark or shows strain"]

  - title: Optic Sign Determination
    content: |
      The optic sign (positive or negative) provides additional diagnostic information.
      It is determined using accessory plates (compensators) with interference figures.
    subsections:
      - title: Uniaxial Optic Sign
        content: |
          Uniaxial positive (+): ε > ω (extraordinary ray has higher RI)
          Uniaxial negative (-): ε < ω (extraordinary ray has lower RI)

          **Using a compensator plate:**
          1. Obtain centred uniaxial figure
          2. Insert compensator (e.g., gypsum plate) at 45°
          3. Observe colour changes in quadrants:
             - **Positive**: Blue in NE/SW quadrants, yellow in NW/SE
             - **Negative**: Yellow in NE/SW quadrants, blue in NW/SE

        table:
          headers:
            - Sign
            - Gems
          rows:
            - ["Uniaxial +", "Quartz, zircon, rutile"]
            - ["Uniaxial -", "Corundum, tourmaline, beryl, apatite, calcite"]

      - title: Biaxial Optic Sign
        content: |
          Biaxial positive (+): β closer to α (lower RI)
          Biaxial negative (-): β closer to γ (higher RI)

          Alternatively: positive = acute bisectrix is Bxa; negative = acute bisectrix is Bxo

          **Using compensator plate:**
          1. Obtain biaxial figure with visible isogyres
          2. Insert compensator at 45°
          3. Observe colour changes along isogyres

      title: Accessory Plates
      text: |
        Common compensator plates:

        - **Gypsum plate** (full-wave, 550nm): Adds or subtracts one wavelength
        - **Mica plate** (quarter-wave, 147nm): More sensitive
        - **Quartz wedge**: Variable compensation

        Colour changes indicate whether birefringence adds to or subtracts from the plate's
        retardation, revealing optic sign.

  - title: Absorption Spectra Reference
    content: |
      The absorption spectrum is one of the most diagnostic optical properties.
      Understanding spectral features helps identify gems and detect treatments.
    subsections:
      - title: Spectral Regions

          headers:
            - Region
            - Wavelength (nm)
            - Colour Absorbed
            - Transmitted Colour

            - ["Violet", "380-450", "Violet/blue", "Yellow/orange"]
            - ["Blue", "450-495", "Blue", "Orange"]

            - ["Red", "620-750", "Red", "Cyan/green"]

      - title: Chromium Spectra
        content: |
          Chromium produces characteristic spectra in many gems:

          - **694nm doublet**: Sharp lines in red (ruby, red spinel, emerald)
          - **Red fluorescence**: Often accompanies Cr absorption
          - **Broad bands in yellow-green**: General absorption creating red colour

          Cr-coloured gems: ruby, red spinel, emerald, alexandrite, chrome tourmaline

      - title: Iron Spectra
        content: |
          Iron produces varied spectra depending on oxidation state:

          - **Fe²⁺**: Bands in blue-green region
          - **Fe³⁺**: Sharp lines, bands in violet-blue
          - **Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ charge transfer**: Broad absorption (blue sapphire)

          Iron is the most common colouring agent and appears in many gems.

  - title: Luminescence
    content: |
      Luminescence is the emission of light from a substance that has absorbed energy.
      The two main types relevant to gemmology are fluorescence and phosphorescence.
    subsections:
      - title: Fluorescence vs Phosphorescence
        comparison:
          items:
            - title: Fluorescence
              points:
                - Immediate emission when illuminated
                - Stops when light source removed
                - Most common in gem testing
                - Tested with UV lamps
            - title: Phosphorescence
              points:
                - Delayed emission
                - Continues after light removed
                - Less common but diagnostic
                - "Example: kunzite, some diamonds"

      - title: Activators and Quenchers
        content: |
          Luminescence depends on trace elements:

          - **Activators**: Cause luminescence (Cr³⁺ → red; Mn²⁺ → orange)
          - **Quenchers**: Suppress luminescence (Fe → often quenches)
          - **Sensitisers**: Enhance other activators' effects

          Example: Burmese ruby fluoresces strongly (low iron); Thai ruby
          fluoresces weakly (high iron quenches).

  - title: Anomalous Double Refraction (ADR)
    content: |
      ADR occurs when isotropic materials show birefringence under polarised light due
      to internal strain rather than crystal structure.
    subsections:
      - title: Causes of ADR
        content: |
          - **Growth strain**: Irregular growth creates internal stress
          - **Thermal stress**: Cooling creates tension
          - **Radiation damage**: Creates local strain fields
          - **Inclusion pressure**: Inclusions create surrounding strain

      - title: ADR Appearance
        content: |
          Under crossed polars, ADR appears as:

          - **Tabby extinction**: Irregular light/dark patches
          - **Strain birefringence**: Patchy, doesn't follow crystal directions
          - **"Tatami" pattern**: Cross-hatched appearance (some garnets)

          Unlike true birefringence, ADR doesn't show normal 4× blink pattern.

    callout:
      type: warning
      title: ADR vs True Double Refraction
      text: |
        ADR can cause confusion in identification:

        - Don't mistake ADR for true anisotropic character
        - Check RI: isotropic minerals give single reading despite ADR
        - ADR doesn't produce interference figures
        - ADR patterns are irregular; true birefringence follows crystal symmetry

        If a stone shows patchy polariscope response but gives a single RI reading,
        suspect ADR.

  - title: Practical Applications
    content: |
      Advanced optical testing is most valuable when standard tests are inconclusive.
    subsections:
      - title: When to Use Advanced Tests
        content: |
          - **Similar RI values**: Need optic sign to distinguish
          - **Possible treatment**: Spectroscopy may reveal heating signs
          - **Origin determination**: Spectral features may be origin-related
          - **Natural vs synthetic**: Fluorescence patterns differ
          - **Unusual specimens**: May require full optical characterisation

      - title: Combined Testing Approach
        content: |
          For complete optical characterisation:

          1. **RI and birefringence**: Refractometer
          2. **Optic character**: Polariscope (isotropic/uniaxial/biaxial)
          3. **Optic sign**: Conoscope with compensator
          4. **Pleochroism**: Dichroscope
          5. **Absorption spectrum**: Spectroscope
          6. **Fluorescence**: UV lamp (LWUV and SWUV)

          Document all results before reaching identification conclusion.
