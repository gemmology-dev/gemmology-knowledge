  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Physical properties are essential for gem identification and determining
      suitability for different types of jewellery. These properties depend on
      the crystal structure and chemical composition.

  - title: Hardness
    content: |
      Hardness measures a mineral's resistance to scratching. The **Mohs scale**
      ranks minerals from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond), but the scale is not linear—diamond
      is approximately 140 times harder than corundum.

      title: Practical Considerations
      text: |
        - Gems with hardness <7 can be scratched by dust (quartz particles)
        - Ring stones should ideally be hardness 7 or above
        - Hardness can vary by direction (kyanite: 4-7)

  - title: Specific Gravity (SG)
    content: |
      Specific gravity is the ratio of a gem's density to that of water. It's a
      diagnostic property that can be measured without damaging the stone using
      hydrostatic weighing.

      **Formula:** `SG = Weight in air / (Weight in air - Weight in water)`
    table:
      caption: SG Ranges by Gemstone
      headers:
        - Range
        - Gemstones
      rows:
        - ["2.0-2.5", "Opal (2.15), Amber (1.08)"]
        - ["2.5-3.0", "Quartz (2.65), Feldspar (2.56-2.76)"]
        - ["3.0-3.5", "Tourmaline (3.06), Jadeite (3.34)"]

        - ["4.0-4.5", "Corundum (4.00), Zircon (4.69)"]
        - [">5.0", "High zircon (4.69), Cassiterite (7.0)"]

  - title: Cleavage
    content: |
      Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along flat planes related to
      its crystal structure. These planes are directions of weaker atomic bonding.
    table:
      caption: Cleavage Quality
      headers:
        - Quality
        - Description
        - Examples
      rows:
        - ["Perfect", "Very smooth, flat surfaces", "Topaz {001}, Fluorite {111}"]
        - ["Good", "Relatively flat but may be stepped", "Feldspar, Spodumene"]
        - ["Distinct", "Recognizable but not dominant", "Beryl (imperfect)"]
        - ["Poor/None", "No preferred break direction", "Quartz, Garnet"]

      title: Cleavage Hazards
      text: |
        Gems with perfect cleavage require careful handling during cutting and setting.
        Diamond has perfect octahedral cleavage {111}, which is used in cleaving
        but makes it vulnerable to sharp blows in certain directions.

  - title: Fracture
    content: |
      Fracture describes how a mineral breaks in directions other than cleavage planes.
    table:
      headers:
        - Type
        - Appearance
        - Examples
      rows:
        - ["Conchoidal", "Curved, shell-like surfaces", "Quartz, Glass, Obsidian"]
        - ["Uneven", "Rough, irregular surface", "Jadeite"]
        - ["Splintery", "Fibrous or needle-like", "Nephrite"]
        - ["Hackly", "Jagged, sharp edges", "Native metals"]

  - title: Lustre
    content: |
      Lustre describes how light interacts with a mineral's surface. It depends on
      the refractive index and surface quality.
    table:
      headers:
        - Lustre
        - Description
        - Examples
      rows:
        - ["Adamantine", "Brilliant, diamond-like (RI >1.9)", "Diamond, Zircon"]
        - ["Vitreous", "Glass-like (most common)", "Quartz, Beryl, Tourmaline"]
        - ["Resinous", "Like resin or plastic", "Amber, Sphalerite"]
        - ["Waxy", "Like candle wax", "Turquoise, Chalcedony"]
        - ["Pearly", "Iridescent, like pearl", "Moonstone, some feldspar"]
        - ["Silky", "Like silk fabric", "Tiger's eye, Satin spar"]

  - title: Tenacity
    content: |
      Tenacity describes a mineral's resistance to breaking, bending, or crushing:

      - **Brittle** - Shatters when struck (most gemstones)
      - **Tough** - Resists breaking despite lower hardness (nephrite, jadeite)
      - **Sectile** - Can be cut with a knife
      - **Flexible** - Bends but doesn't return (mica)
      - **Elastic** - Bends and returns to shape

      title: Toughness vs. Hardness
      text: |
        Nephrite jade (H: 6-6.5) is tougher than diamond (H: 10) because its interlocking
        fibrous structure resists fracture. This makes jade ideal for carving despite
        its lower hardness.

  - title: Specific Gravity Measurement Techniques
    content: |
      Specific gravity (SG) is one of the most reliable diagnostic properties and can be
      measured without damaging the stone. Two main methods are used in gemmology.
    subsections:
      - title: Hydrostatic Weighing
        content: |
          The most accurate method for loose stones:

          1. Weigh stone in air (W₁)
          2. Suspend stone in water on a wire bridge
          3. Weigh stone in water (W₂)
          4. Calculate: SG = W₁ / (W₁ - W₂)

          **Accuracy considerations:**
          - Use distilled water at 4°C for best accuracy
          - Account for surface tension on small stones
          - Wire bridge weight must be tared
          - Ensure no air bubbles trapped on stone
          - Multiple measurements improve reliability

      - title: Heavy Liquids Method
        content: |
          Liquids of known SG can quickly estimate stone density:

          - **Methylene iodide** (SG 3.32): Good for many gems
          - **Clerici solution** (SG up to 4.2): For denser stones
          - **Diluted solutions**: Create intermediate densities

          If stone **floats**, SG < liquid; if **sinks**, SG > liquid; if **suspends**, SG = liquid

          *Note*: Many heavy liquids are toxic; follow safety protocols.

      - title: SG Accuracy and Limitations

          headers:
            - Factor
            - Effect on SG
          rows:
            - ["Inclusions", "May raise or lower SG depending on inclusion type"]
            - ["Fractures", "May trap air, lowering apparent SG"]
            - ["Porosity", "Porous stones absorb water, affecting result"]
            - ["Temperature", "Water density changes with temperature"]
            - ["Stone size", "Very small stones harder to measure accurately"]

  - title: Directional Hardness
    content: |
      Some minerals have significantly different hardness depending on crystal direction.
      This property, called directional hardness or anisotropic hardness, has important
      practical implications.
    subsections:
      - title: Kyanite
        content: |
          Kyanite is the classic example of extreme directional hardness:

          - **Parallel to c-axis** (length): H 4-4.5
          - **Perpendicular to c-axis**: H 6-7

          This 3-point variation affects cutting and polishing—different directions
          require different approaches.

      - title: Diamond
        content: |
          Diamond's hardness varies by crystal direction:

          - **Octahedral faces {111}**: Hardest direction
          - **Cube faces {100}**: Slightly softer
          - **Dodecahedral faces {110}**: Softest

          Diamond cutters exploit these differences. Sawing is done parallel to
          cubic planes; polishing uses the harder octahedral direction.

      - title: Practical Implications
        content: |
          Directional hardness affects:

          - Polishing quality (some directions polish better)
          - Wear patterns (soft directions wear faster)
          - Cutting approach (orient for best finish)
          - Durability assessment (softest direction matters)

  - title: Thermal Conductivity
    content: |
      Thermal conductivity measures how quickly heat flows through a material. This
      property is particularly useful for diamond testing and identification.
    subsections:
      - title: Diamond vs Simulants
        table:
          headers:
            - Material
            - Thermal Conductivity
            - Thermal Probe Result
          rows:
            - ["Diamond", "Very high (2000+ W/m·K)", "Positive (conducts heat rapidly)"]
            - ["Moissanite", "High (490 W/m·K)", "Positive (may test as diamond)"]
            - ["CZ", "Low (2 W/m·K)", "Negative"]
            - ["Glass", "Very low (1 W/m·K)", "Negative"]
            - ["Other gems", "Low to moderate", "Negative"]

      - title: Thermal Probe Testing
        content: |
          Thermal testers work by measuring heat dissipation from a heated probe tip:

          - Probe touches stone surface
          - Heat flows from probe into stone
          - Faster cooling = higher thermal conductivity

          **Limitations:**
          - Moissanite also conducts heat well (false positive)
          - Metal mountings can affect readings
          - Stone must be room temperature
          - Small stones may give unreliable results

      - title: Combined Thermal-Electrical Testing
        content: |
          Modern testers combine thermal and electrical conductivity:

          - Diamond: High thermal, no electrical conductivity
          - Moissanite: High thermal, *electrical* conductivity
          - This distinguishes diamond from moissanite reliably

          Most synthetic moissanite (SiC) is an electrical semiconductor, while
          natural diamond (except rare Type IIb blue) is an insulator.
