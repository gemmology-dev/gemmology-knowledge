  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Organic gems are materials produced by living organisms rather than geological
      processes. They include products from molluscs (pearls, mother-of-pearl), marine
      invertebrates (coral), tree resin (amber), and various other biological sources.

      Organic gems are typically softer and more fragile than mineral gems, requiring
      special care in handling, setting, and cleaning. They also have unique grading
      criteria related to their biological origins.

  - title: Pearl
    content: |
      Pearls are the most commercially important organic gems, formed when a mollusc
      deposits concentric layers of nacre (aragonite crystals bound by conchiolin)
      around an irritant.
    subsections:
      - title: Natural vs Cultured
        content: |
          - **Natural pearls**: Form spontaneously without human intervention; extremely rare
          - **Cultured pearls**: Human-initiated by inserting a bead nucleus or tissue
          - **Both are real pearls**: Cultured pearls are not fake or imitation

          Nearly all pearls in today's market are cultured. Natural pearls are primarily
          found in antique jewellery or specialist auctions.

      - title: Freshwater Pearls
        content: |
          Freshwater pearls are cultivated primarily in China's lakes and rivers:

          - **Historically**: Irregular shapes, rice grain, baroque
          - **Modern**: Round shapes now possible (Edison, Ming pearls)
          - **Nacre**: Often solid nacre (no bead nucleus)
          - **Colours**: White, pink, lavender, peach
          - **Price**: Generally lower than saltwater equivalents

        - ["Lustre", "Surface reflection and depth of glow", "Mirror-like, sharp reflections"]
        - ["Surface", "Blemishes, spots, pits", "Clean or near-clean"]

      title: Lustre is Paramount
      text: |
        Lustre is the most important pearl quality factor. A smaller pearl with excellent
        lustre will outvalue a larger pearl with chalky, dull lustre. Fine lustre shows
        sharp light reflections and a sense of depth—the light appears to come from
        within the pearl.

          - **Microscopy**: Surface structure examination

  - title: Coral
    content: |
      Precious coral is the calcified skeleton of colonial marine animals (genus
      Corallium). The most valuable is deep-red "ox blood" coral from the Mediterranean
      and Japanese waters.

          Common coral treatments include:

          - **Dyeing**: Pale coral dyed to improve colour
          - **Bleaching**: Orange coral lightened
          - **Waxing/oiling**: Improve lustre
          - **Impregnation**: Stabilise porous material

      title: CITES and Conservation
      text: |
        Many coral species are protected under CITES (Convention on International Trade
        in Endangered Species). Trade regulations vary by species and country.

        - Check import/export requirements before purchasing
        - Request documentation for valuable pieces
        - Ethical alternatives exist (fossil coral, bamboo coral dyed)

  - title: Amber
    content: |
      Amber is fossilised tree resin, typically 20-50 million years old. It is valued
      for its warm golden colour, transparency, and inclusions of ancient life forms.
    subsections:
      - title: Major Sources

            - ["Dominican Republic", "20-30 million years", "Often blue fluorescence; rare blue amber"]
            - ["Myanmar (Burmese)", "100 million years", "Often with inclusions; scientifically valuable"]
            - ["Mexican (Chiapas)", "20-30 million years", "Similar to Dominican"]

      - title: Properties
        content: |
          - **Composition**: Organic polymers (no fixed formula)
          - **Hardness**: 2-2.5 Mohs (very soft)
          - **SG**: 1.05-1.10 (floats in saturated salt water)
          - **RI**: 1.54 (single refraction; often has internal strain)

      - title: Inclusions
        content: |
          Amber is famous for preserving ancient life:

          - **Insects**: Flies, ants, beetles, wasps
          - **Spiders**: Often with webs
          - **Plant material**: Leaves, flowers, seeds
          - **Air bubbles**: Common, create cloudy appearance

          Inclusions increase value significantly, especially rare or well-preserved specimens.

      - title: Amber vs Copal
        content: |
          **Copal** is younger, semi-fossilised resin (typically <1 million years):

          - Softer than amber
          - Dissolves more readily in solvents (acetone test)
          - Often sold as amber (misrepresentation)
          - Lower value than true amber

  - title: Jet
    content: |
      Jet is fossilised wood (related to coal) that has been used as a gem material
      since prehistoric times. It is most famous from Whitby, England.
    subsections:
      - title: Properties
        content: |
          - **Composition**: Fossilised driftwood (compact lignite)
          - **Hardness**: 2.5-4 Mohs
          - **SG**: 1.30-1.35 (very light)
          - **Colour**: Black (can show brown in thin sections)
          - **Lustre**: Waxy when polished

      - title: Historical Significance
        content: |
          Jet was extremely fashionable in Victorian England, especially for mourning
          jewellery after Prince Albert's death (1861). Whitby jet remains the most
          valued source.

      - title: Identification
        content: |
          Jet may be confused with:

          - **Black glass (Paris jet)**: Heavier (SG 2.3+), cold to touch
          - **Vulcanite (hard rubber)**: Rubbery smell when heated
          - **Bakelite**: Different feel; may show mold marks
          - **Black onyx**: Much harder (H 7), heavier

          Hot needle test produces coal-like smell for genuine jet.

  - title: Shell Materials
    content: |
      Various mollusc shells are used in jewellery, primarily for their iridescent
      nacre (mother-of-pearl) or unique colours.
    subsections:

        content: |
          The nacreous inner lining of shells, composed of aragonite platelets:

          - **Sources**: Abalone, pearl oyster, freshwater mussel
          - **Uses**: Inlay, buttons, watch dials, decorative items
          - **Properties**: Iridescent, soft (H 2.5-4.5)

      - title: Abalone
        content: |
          The shell of sea snails (genus Haliotis) prized for strong iridescence:

          - **Colours**: Blue, green, purple, pink
          - **Uses**: Inlay, cabochons, decorative pieces
          - **Care**: Sensitive to acids and heat

          Rare, non-nacreous pearls from the queen conch (Strombus gigas):

          - **Colour**: Pink to orange-pink
          - **Structure**: Flame-like pattern on surface
          - **Rarity**: Cannot be cultured; very rare
          - **Value**: Fine specimens command high prices

  - title: Ivory and Alternatives

        Organic gems require special handling:

        - **Heat**: Avoid high temperatures (can crack, dry out)
        - **Chemicals**: Avoid perfumes, hairspray, cosmetics, acids
        - **Drying**: Pearls need humidity; store with damp cloth nearby
        - **Cleaning**: Warm water and mild soap only; no ultrasonic
        - **Storage**: Separate from harder gems; fabric-lined containers
        - **Wearing**: Put on last, remove first (to avoid cosmetic contact)
