  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Fluid inclusions are cavities containing liquids, gases, or combinations trapped
      during crystal growth. They provide crucial information about the conditions under
      which the gem formed and are often diagnostic for origin determination.

  - title: Types of Fluid Inclusions
    subsections:
      - title: Single-Phase Inclusions
        content: |
          Contain only one phase (liquid or gas):

          - **Liquid-filled** - Cavities filled with liquid only
          - **Gas-filled** - Rare, usually in volcanic-origin gems
          - Typically smaller than multi-phase inclusions

      - title: Two-Phase Inclusions
        content: |
          The most common type, containing liquid and a gas bubble:

          - **Appearance**: Liquid-filled cavity with a mobile gas bubble
          - **Behaviour**: Bubble moves when stone is tilted
          - **Common in**: Topaz, aquamarine, tourmaline, spinel
          - **Identification value**: Confirms natural origin

      - title: Three-Phase Inclusions
        content: |
          Contain liquid, gas, and a solid crystal - highly diagnostic:

          - **Components**: Liquid + gas bubble + solid crystal (often halite)
          - **Classic example**: Colombian emerald (jagged cavity with halite cube)
          - **Diagnostic value**: Often origin-specific
          - **Also seen in**: Some quartz, topaz, spinel

      title: Diagnostic Feature
      text: |
        The three-phase inclusion in Colombian emerald is one of the most diagnostic
        features in gemmology:

        - **Liquid**: Saline fluid (NaCl solution)
        - **Gas**: CO2 bubble
        - **Solid**: Cubic halite (NaCl) crystal

        This combination is virtually diagnostic of Colombian origin and proves
        natural origin. The jagged, irregular cavity shape is also characteristic.

  - title: Negative Crystals
    content: |
      Negative crystals are fluid-filled cavities that have the geometric shape of the
      host mineral's crystal structure:

      - **Formation**: Cavity walls follow crystal structure
      - **Shape**: Reflects host mineral's crystal habit
      - **Examples**:
        - Octahedral negative crystals in spinel
        - Hexagonal negative crystals in beryl
        - Rhombohedral negative crystals in quartz

      items:
        - title: Colombian
          variant: success
          points:
            - Three-phase inclusions (diagnostic)
            - Jagged cavity walls
            - Halite cubes in fluid
            - '"Jardin" garden-like appearance'
        - title: Zambian
          points:
            - Two-phase inclusions dominant
            - Blocky fluid cavities
            - Less halite, more biotite
            - Generally cleaner appearance
        - title: Brazilian
          points:
            - Two-phase inclusions
            - Biotite mica common
            - Pyrite crystals
            - Chromite occasionally

  - title: Moving Bubble Test
    content: |
      Some fluid inclusions contain mobile gas bubbles that can be observed moving:

      **Observation technique:**
      1. Place gem under microscope
      2. Locate two-phase inclusion with visible bubble
      3. Gently tilt the stone
      4. Observe bubble movement within cavity

      **Significance:**
      - Confirms liquid-filled cavity (not solid)
      - Natural feature (synthetics rarely show this)
      - Documents inclusion type accurately

      title: Heat Treatment Effects
      text: |
        Heat treatment can significantly alter fluid inclusions:

        - **Expansion**: Gas bubbles may expand or burst
        - **Decrepitation**: Inclusions may crack or explode
        - **Residue**: "Snowflake" patterns from burst inclusions
        - **Healing**: Some fractures may heal during treatment

        The presence of intact, well-formed fluid inclusions generally indicates
        no high-temperature heat treatment, while damaged or altered inclusions
        may suggest treatment.
