  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Silk refers to fine, needle-like inclusions that create a silky lustre in gemstones.
      Most commonly composed of rutile (TiO2) in corundum, silk is one of the most
      important diagnostic features for both identification and origin determination.

  - title: Rutile Silk in Corundum
    content: |
      Rutile silk is the defining internal feature of many natural corundums:

      **Composition:**
      - Titanium dioxide (TiO2) crystals
      - Exsolved from corundum lattice during cooling
      - Oriented along crystallographic directions (60° intersections)

      **Appearance:**
      - Fine, needle-like crystals
      - Often intersecting at 60° angles
      - Creates silky sheen when dense
      - Length and density vary by origin

      The characteristics of rutile silk are crucial for origin determination in corundum:

          variant: success
          points:
            - Short, fine rutile needles
            - Delicate, wispy appearance
            - Creates soft, velvety look
            - '"Finest" silk considered'
        - title: Sri Lankan (Ceylon)
          points:
            - Long, prominent needles
            - Clearly visible individual needles
            - Often creates strong asterism
            - More widely spaced
        - title: Thai/Cambodian
          variant: warning
          points:
            - Dense networks of silk
            - Often very heavy coverage
            - Can make stones appear cloudy
            - Iron-rich environment

      title: The Kashmir Effect
      text: |
        Kashmir sapphires are famous for their "velvety" or "sleepy" appearance:

        - **Cause**: Extremely fine, microscopic particles (not classic rutile silk)
        - **Appearance**: Soft, hazey internal glow
        - **Effect**: Creates prized "velvety" lustre
        - **Diagnostic**: Combined with tourmaline inclusions, zircon halos

        This fine scattering effect is different from classic rutile silk and is
        highly sought after, commanding premium prices.

  - title: Silk and Asterism
    content: |
      Dense, properly oriented silk creates star effects (asterism):

      **Requirements for asterism:**
      - Sufficient density of silk needles
      - Proper orientation (intersecting at 60°)
      - Correct cutting (cabochon, oriented perpendicular to c-axis)

      **Star types:**
      - **6-ray star** - Three sets of silk at 60° (common in corundum)
      - **12-ray star** - Six sets of needles (rare, exceptional)
      - **4-ray star** - Two sets at 90° (in garnets, diopside)

  - title: Heat Treatment Effects on Silk
    content: |
      Heat treatment significantly affects silk appearance:

      **Low to moderate heat:**
      - Silk may partially dissolve
      - Needles become interrupted ("dotted silk")
      - Stone clarity improves

      **High heat:**
      - Silk completely dissolves
      - Titanium re-enters corundum lattice
      - Stone becomes cleaner but loses silk

      **Diagnostic value:**
      - Intact silk suggests no high-temperature treatment
      - Dissolved/dotted silk indicates heat treatment
      - Complete absence may indicate treatment or origin

      title: Treatment Detection
      text: |
        The state of silk is a primary indicator for heat treatment detection:

        - **Intact, sharp silk**: Likely unheated
        - **Dotted, broken silk**: Heat treated
        - **Complete absence** (in stone that should have silk): Suspect treatment

    subsections:
      - title: Tourmaline Trichites
        content: |
          Tourmaline contains distinctive needle-like inclusions:

          - **Trichites**: Hair-like thread inclusions
          - Often in parallel groups
          - Different from rutile silk
          - Characteristic of species

      - title: Amphibole Needles
        content: |
          Found in various gemstones:

          - **In emerald**: Tremolite/actinolite needles (especially Afghan, Russian)
          - **In demantoid**: Byssolite (actinolite) "horsetail"
          - **In peridot**: Ludwigite needles (rare)

      - title: Garnet Silk
        content: |
          Some garnets contain silk-like inclusions:

          - Almandine often has rutile needles
          - Rhodolite may show fine silk
          - Creates asterism in some star garnets

      title: Examining Silk
      text: |
        For best observation of silk:

        1. **Use darkfield illumination** - Silk appears bright against dark background
        2. **Rotate the stone** - Different orientations reveal intersecting sets
        3. **Try fibre-optic light** - Pinpoint illumination shows individual needles
        4. **Note density and length** - Key for origin determination
        5. **Check for interruptions** - Broken silk indicates heat treatment

        Document silk characteristics carefully as they are crucial for both
        identification and origin/treatment conclusions.
