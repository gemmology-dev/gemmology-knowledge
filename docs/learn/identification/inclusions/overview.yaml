  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Inclusions are internal features that provide valuable information about a gem's
      identity, origin, and natural vs. synthetic status. They are a gem's "fingerprint."

      Understanding inclusions is fundamental to gemmological identification. Each gemstone
      species, and often each geographic origin, exhibits characteristic inclusion patterns
      that aid in accurate identification.

  - title: Classification of Inclusions
    content: |
      Inclusions can be classified by their nature and timing of formation:

      **By Nature:**
      - **Solid inclusions** - Crystals of other minerals
      - **Fluid inclusions** - Trapped liquids, gases, or combinations
      - **Growth features** - Patterns from crystallization process

      **By Timing (Relative to Host Crystal):**
      - **Protogenetic** - Formed before the host crystal
      - **Syngenetic** - Formed at the same time as the host
      - **Epigenetic** - Formed after the host crystal

  - title: Microscopy Techniques
    content: |
      Different lighting techniques reveal different inclusion types:

      - **Darkfield** - Best for seeing inclusions against dark background
      - **Brightfield** - Good for colour zoning and growth patterns
      - **Fibre-optic** - Pinpoint light for specific features
      - **Immersion** - Reduces surface reflections, reveals internal features
      - **Polarized light** - Shows strain patterns and twinning

      text: |
        The diamond grading standard uses 10x magnification as the benchmark for clarity
        grading. However, for detailed inclusion study in coloured stones, 40-60x
        magnification is often preferred for accurate identification of inclusion
        types and origins.

      title: Recording Inclusions
      text: |
        When documenting inclusions:

        1. **Describe location**: Crown, pavilion, near girdle, etc.
        2. **Note visibility**: Visible to naked eye or only under magnification
        3. **Identify type**: Crystal, feather, cloud, needle, etc.
        4. **Record effect**: Impact on transparency, durability, beauty
        5. **Photograph**: Multiple magnifications and lighting angles

        Systematic documentation creates valuable reference material for future
        comparisons and supports identification conclusions.
