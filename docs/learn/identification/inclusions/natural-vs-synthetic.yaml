  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Inclusions provide crucial evidence for distinguishing natural gemstones from
      their synthetic counterparts. While synthetics may have the same chemical
      composition and crystal structure, their formation conditions differ dramatically,
      leaving characteristic internal features.

          points:
            - Curved striae (flame fusion)

            - Platinum/gold flakes (flux)

  - title: Flame Fusion (Verneuil) Synthetics
    content: |
      Flame fusion is the oldest and most common method for synthetic corundum and spinel:

      **Characteristic inclusions:**
      - **Curved striae** - Curved growth lines (most diagnostic)
      - **Gas bubbles** - Round or elongated bubbles, often in strings
      - **Unmelted powder** - Rare, small grains of starting material

      **Observation tips:**
      - Curved striae best seen with immersion and polarized light
      - Bubbles may be very small - use high magnification
      - Striae follow the curved boule shape

      title: Key Feature
      text: |
        **Curved striae** are the most diagnostic feature of flame fusion synthetics.
        Natural corundum shows straight or angular zoning that follows crystal faces,
        never curved lines. This single feature can definitively identify a flame
        fusion synthetic.

  - title: Flux-Grown Synthetics
    content: |
      Flux-grown synthetics crystallize from a molten flux solution:

      **Characteristic inclusions:**
      - **Flux inclusions** - Wispy, veil-like, or fingerprint-like patterns
      - **Platinum/gold flakes** - Metallic crucible remnants
      - **Flux residue** - Glassy or crystalline flux material
      - **Seed remnants** - If grown on a seed crystal

      **Important distinctions:**
      - Flux inclusions can resemble natural fingerprints
      - Look for metallic flakes (not present in nature)
      - Flux has distinctive appearance different from natural fluids

        - ["Three-phase inclusions", "Never", "Common in emerald"]

  - title: Hydrothermal Synthetics
    content: |
      Hydrothermal synthetics grow from aqueous solutions at high pressure:

      **Characteristic inclusions:**
      - **Chevron/zigzag zoning** - Distinctive angular growth patterns
      - **Seed plate** - Remnant of the seed crystal
      - **Breadcrumb inclusions** - Small, white, scattered particles
      - **Nail-head spicules** - Elongated, pointed inclusions

      **Common hydrothermal synthetics:**
      - Synthetic emerald (Biron, Tairus, Russian)
      - Synthetic quartz (most common method)
      - Some synthetic corundum

      title: Hydrothermal Emerald
      text: |
        Hydrothermal synthetic emeralds can be challenging because they may contain
        phenakite crystals (a natural mineral). However, they never show:

        - Three-phase inclusions with halite cubes
        - Jardin-style inclusion patterns
        - Natural mineral suites (mica, pyrite, etc.)

        The chevron zoning pattern is often visible and diagnostic.

  - title: CVD and HPHT Diamond
    content: |
      Lab-grown diamonds require special attention:

      **HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature):**
      - Metallic flux inclusions (Fe, Ni, Co)
      - Cross-shaped or irregular patterns
      - Strong magnetism possible
      - Distinctive fluorescence patterns

      **CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition):**
      - Often very clean
      - May show strain patterns
      - Point defects from process
      - Distinctive spectroscopy features

  - title: Synthetic Spinel Indicators
    content: |
      Synthetic spinel is commonly produced by flame fusion:

      **Key features:**
      - **Gas bubbles** - Very common, often in clouds or strings
      - **Curved striae** - Similar to synthetic corundum
      - **Anomalous double refraction (ADR)** - Strong strain patterns
      - **High clarity** - Often cleaner than natural

      title: Systematic Approach
      text: |
        When examining for natural vs synthetic:

        1. **Start with magnification** - Look for bubbles, curved striae, flux
        2. **Use immersion** - Enhances visibility of growth patterns
        3. **Try polarized light** - Reveals strain and zoning patterns
        4. **Check for natural minerals** - Crystal inclusions prove natural origin
        5. **Look for three-phase inclusions** - Diagnostic for natural emerald
        6. **Document everything** - Photograph key features

        A single definitive feature (curved striae, metallic flux, mineral inclusions)
        can establish origin. When uncertain, additional testing is required.

  - title: When Inclusions Aren't Enough
    content: |
      Some cases require advanced testing beyond microscopy:

      **Challenging scenarios:**
      - Very clean natural stones with few inclusions
      - High-quality flux synthetics
      - CVD diamonds (often very clean)
      - Treated naturals with altered inclusions

      **Additional testing methods:**
      - Spectroscopy (FTIR, Raman, UV-Vis)
      - Fluorescence imaging
      - Trace element analysis
      - Photoluminescence mapping

      When microscopic evidence is inconclusive, always recommend advanced testing
      by a qualified gemmological laboratory.
