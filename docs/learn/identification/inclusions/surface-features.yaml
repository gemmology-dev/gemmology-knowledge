  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Surface features are characteristics found at or near the surface of gemstones.
      While strictly speaking not "inclusions" (which are internal), these features
      are often considered together in gem examination and significantly impact
      clarity grading, particularly in diamonds.

  - title: Naturals
    content: |
      Naturals are remnants of the original crystal surface left on a cut gemstone:

      **Characteristics:**
      - Original rough crystal surface preserved
      - Usually found on or near the girdle
      - May show trigons (triangular growth marks)
      - Often left deliberately to preserve weight

      **Significance:**
      - Proves natural origin (synthetics don't have naturals)
      - Acceptable in diamond grading if confined to girdle
      - Should not affect face-up appearance

  - title: Types of Naturals
    table:
      headers:
        - Type
        - Description
        - Location
      rows:
        - ["Surface natural", "Flat area of original surface", "Girdle area"]
        - ["Indented natural", "Extends below polished surface", "Girdle or near"]
        - ["Natural with trigons", "Shows triangular growth marks", "Any natural surface"]
        - ["Twinning natural", "Related to twin plane", "Follows twin orientation"]

  - title: Bearding (Girdle Fringes)
    content: |
      Bearding consists of tiny fractures along the girdle, created during cutting:

      **Formation:**
      - Created by the bruting (girdling) process
      - Mechanical stress causes minute fractures
      - Extends from girdle into stone interior

      **Appearance:**
      - Hair-like fractures at girdle edge
      - Creates "fuzzy" or "fringed" appearance
      - Severity ranges from minor to extensive

      **Grading impact:**
      - Minor bearding often acceptable
      - Heavy bearding can affect clarity grade
      - May be reduced by re-polishing girdle

  - title: Extra Facets
    content: |
      Extra facets are small additional polished surfaces not part of the standard cut:

      **Purposes:**
      - Remove surface-reaching inclusions
      - Eliminate naturals or damage
      - Correct cutting errors

      **Location:**
      - Often on pavilion near girdle
      - May be on crown
      - Should not be visible face-up (ideally)

      **Grading consideration:**
      - Generally considered a blemish
      - Impact depends on visibility
      - Very common in coloured stones

  - title: Surface Graining
    content: |
      Surface graining appears as visible growth lines on polished surfaces:

      **Types:**
      - **Whitish graining** - Light-coloured lines
      - **Reflective graining** - Shiny, mirror-like lines
      - **Transparent graining** - Subtle lines, often internal origin

      **Relationship to internal graining:**
      - Surface graining often continues internally
      - Represents structural irregularities
      - Related to crystal growth conditions

  - title: Etch Channels and Figures
    content: |
      Etch features result from natural dissolution processes:

      **Etch channels:**
      - Tube-like cavities extending from surface
      - Created by corrosive fluids during geological history
      - Often follow crystallographic directions
      - Can contain secondary minerals

      **Etch figures:**
      - Geometric depressions on crystal faces
      - Reflect underlying crystal symmetry
      - Trigons on diamond (triangular pits)
      - Hexagonal pits on corundum

      title: Diagnostic Feature
      text: |
        Trigons are triangular growth or etch marks found on natural diamond surfaces:

        **Types:**
        - **Positive trigons**: Raised, point-up triangles (growth)
        - **Negative trigons**: Depressed, point-down triangles (dissolution)

        **Significance:**
        - Prove natural origin (synthetics lack trigons)
        - Found on naturals that preserve rough surface
        - Important diagnostic feature

        Trigons are oriented opposite to the octahedral face orientation, reflecting
        diamond's crystal structure.

        - ["Scratch", "Linear surface mark", "Abrasion damage"]

  - title: Laser Drill Holes
    content: |
      Laser drilling is a treatment that creates access channels to internal inclusions:

      **Purpose:**
      - Access dark inclusions for bleaching
      - Improve apparent clarity

      **Appearance:**
      - Very fine, straight channels
      - May appear as tiny dots on surface
      - Often lead to bleached inclusion sites
      - Visible under magnification

      **Detection:**
      - Look for unnaturally straight tubes
      - Follow tube to inclusion site
      - May show surface opening

      type: warning
      title: Disclosure Required
      text: |
        Laser drilling is a **permanent treatment** that must be disclosed. The drill
        holes are small but permanent features. Laser-drilled diamonds should be
        identified and disclosed as treated.

        Some laser drill holes are very small and require careful examination under
        magnification to detect.

      - title: Coloured Stone Surface Features
        content: |
          Coloured stones show various surface features:

          - **Etch channels** - Common in natural stones
          - **Surface pitting** - From pulled inclusions
          - **Cleavage cracks** - Reaching surface
          - **Growth hillocks** - Raised areas on crystal faces
          - **Cavity fillings** - Evidence of treatments

  - title: Examination Protocol

      title: Surface Feature Examination
      text: |
        For thorough surface feature examination:

        1. **Clean the stone** - Dirt can obscure features
        2. **Use reflected light** - Shows surface relief
        3. **Examine the girdle** - Most features concentrate here
        4. **Check facet junctions** - Common chip locations
        5. **Look for drill holes** - Especially if clarity seems improved
        6. **Document position** - Note location for mapping

        Surface features often provide important evidence about a stone's history,
        treatment status, and authenticity.
