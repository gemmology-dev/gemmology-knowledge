  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Growth features are internal patterns formed during crystallization. Unlike solid
      or fluid inclusions which are "foreign" material, growth features are intrinsic
      to the crystal's development and reflect changing conditions during formation.

  - title: Colour Zoning
    content: |
      Colour zoning results from variations in trace element concentration during growth:

      **Formation:**
      - Changes in fluid chemistry during crystallization
      - Different growth faces incorporate elements at different rates
      - Temperature or pressure fluctuations

      **Types:**
      - **Straight zoning** - Parallel bands following crystal faces
      - **Angular zoning** - Follows hexagonal or other crystal geometry
      - **Irregular zoning** - Patchy, non-geometric distribution
      - **Sector zoning** - Different colours in different growth sectors

  - title: Growth Tubes
    content: |
      Hollow channels formed parallel to the crystal's c-axis during growth:

      **Characteristics:**
      - Elongated, tube-like cavities
      - Usually parallel to main growth direction
      - May contain fluid or be empty
      - Can create "rain-like" appearance

      **Common in:**
      - Tourmaline (very characteristic)
      - Aquamarine (parallel tubes)
      - Some garnets (rare)

  - title: Twinning
    content: |
      Twinning occurs when crystal lattices join in specific orientations:

      **Types:**
      - **Contact twins** - Two crystals joined at a plane
      - **Penetration twins** - Crystals interpenetrate
      - **Polysynthetic twins** - Multiple parallel twin planes

      **Appearance under magnification:**
      - Reflection planes visible internally
      - Interference colours under polarized light
      - Step-like features at twin boundaries

        - ["Calcite", "Contact twins", "Common, affects cleavage"]

  - title: Phantoms
    content: |
      Phantom inclusions show earlier growth stages preserved inside the crystal:

      **Formation:**
      - Crystal growth temporarily stops
      - Surface accumulates dust or mineral coating
      - Growth resumes, encasing earlier form

      **Appearance:**
      - Ghost-like outline of earlier crystal
      - Often shows different colour or clarity
      - Demonstrates crystal's growth history

      **Common in:**
      - Quartz (chlorite or iron oxide phantoms)
      - Fluorite (colour change phantoms)
      - Occasionally in other minerals

  - title: Internal Graining
    content: |
      Internal graining results from structural irregularities during growth:

      **Types:**
      - **Whitish graining** - Light-coloured lines or planes
      - **Reflective graining** - Shiny internal reflections
      - **Coloured graining** - Associated with colour distribution

      **Most significant in diamonds:**
      - Affects clarity grading
      - Can indicate plastic deformation
      - May show strain patterns

  - title: Strain Patterns
    content: |
      Visible under crossed polarizers, strain patterns reveal internal stress:

      **Causes:**
      - Rapid temperature changes during formation
      - Pressure from included crystals
      - Tectonic stress during geological history

      **Observation:**
      - Best seen with polarized light
      - Appears as interference colours
      - Patterns radiate from stress sources

          points:
            - Curved striae (flame fusion)
            - Chevron/zigzag (hydrothermal)
            - Very regular spacing
            - Uninterrupted patterns
            - May follow seed plate

      title: Best Practice for Growth Features
      text: |
        To observe growth features effectively:

        1. **Use immersion** - Reduces surface reflections
        2. **Try polarized light** - Reveals strain and twinning
        3. **Rotate the stone** - Different angles reveal different features
        4. **Use brightfield lighting** - Better for zoning than darkfield
        5. **Adjust magnification** - Lower power for overall patterns

        Growth features are often subtle - take time to examine systematically.
