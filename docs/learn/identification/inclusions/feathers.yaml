  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Feathers and fingerprints are healed or partially healed fractures within gemstones.
      These features form when fractures that developed during or after crystal growth
      are subsequently healed by circulating fluids, leaving characteristic patterns.

  - title: Feathers
    content: |
      Feathers are internal fractures that have a wispy, feathery appearance:

      **Characteristics:**
      - Appear as wispy, irregular planes
      - May show iridescence from thin-film interference
      - Can affect durability if reaching surface
      - Common term used in diamond grading

      **Formation:**
      - Stress during crystal growth
      - Post-formation stress or shock
      - Partial healing may occur

  - title: Fingerprint Inclusions
    content: |
      Fingerprint inclusions are healed fractures with characteristic patterns:

      **Appearance:**
      - Networks of tiny fluid remnants
      - Pattern resembles human fingerprints
      - Often show maze-like or net-like design
      - May contain scattered droplets

      **Formation process:**
      1. Fracture develops in crystal
      2. Fluids enter the fracture
      3. Crystal partially heals around fluid
      4. Trapped fluid forms fingerprint pattern

      rows:
        - ["Spinel", "Very characteristic, fine network", "Strong natural indicator"]

        - ["Topaz", "Less common", "Natural indicator"]

  - title: Liquid Feathers
    content: |
      Liquid feathers are partially healed fractures still containing significant fluid:

      **Characteristics:**
      - Feather-like fracture outline
      - Visible fluid within the fracture
      - May contain gas bubbles
      - Can show movement when tilted

      **Common in:**
      - Spessartine garnet (very characteristic)
      - Some tourmalines
      - Various other gems

      title: Treatment Indicator
      text: |
        In heat-treated corundum, flux-assisted healing creates distinctive fingerprints:

        **Flux fingerprints:**
        - Formed during high-temperature treatment with flux
        - Show characteristic "fuzzy" or "cotton-like" appearance
        - May contain flux residue (glassy material)
        - Indicate heat treatment

        Compare to **natural fingerprints** which are sharper and more defined.
        This distinction is crucial for treatment detection.

  - title: Stress Fractures
    content: |
      Stress fractures form around included crystals due to differential expansion:

      **Formation:**
      - Included crystal has different thermal expansion
      - Temperature changes create stress
      - Fractures radiate from inclusion

      **Examples:**
      - **Zircon halos** in corundum and other gems
      - **Tension cracks** around garnet inclusions
      - **Discoid fractures** (lily pads) around chromite in peridot

  - title: Lily Pad Inclusions
    content: |
      Lily pad inclusions are diagnostic for peridot:

      **Description:**
      - Flat, disc-shaped stress fractures
      - Radiate from a central crystal inclusion
      - Resemble lily pads on a pond
      - Usually surrounding chromite crystals

      **Diagnostic value:**
      - Virtually diagnostic for peridot
      - Confirms natural origin
      - One of most distinctive inclusion types

          points:
            - Irregular, curved surfaces
            - Can occur in any direction
            - Often partially healed
            - Show fingerprint patterns when healed
            - Various causes (stress, shock)
        - title: Cleavage Cracks
          points:
            - Flat, planar surfaces
            - Follow specific crystallographic planes
            - Sharp, well-defined edges
            - Often step-like appearance
            - Related to crystal structure

      title: Durability Considerations
      text: |
        Feathers can affect a gemstone's durability:

        **High risk:**
        - Feathers reaching the surface
        - Large feathers in girdle area
        - Multiple intersecting fractures

        **Lower risk:**
        - Small, fully internal feathers
        - Well-healed fingerprints
        - Feathers not near vulnerable areas

        When assessing gems for jewellery use, consider the location and extent
        of feathers relative to the setting style planned.

  - title: Observation Techniques
    content: |
      To observe feathers and fingerprints effectively:

      **Lighting:**
      - **Darkfield** - Best for seeing feathers as bright features
      - **Fibre-optic** - Pinpoint illumination for detail
      - **Reflected light** - Shows surface-reaching fractures

      **Method:**
      1. Start with low magnification for overview
      2. Increase magnification for pattern detail
      3. Rotate stone to see full extent of feature
      4. Note whether feature reaches surface
