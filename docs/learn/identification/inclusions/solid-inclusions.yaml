    content: |
      Solid inclusions are crystals of other minerals trapped during the host gem's growth.
      They are typically protogenetic (formed before the host) or syngenetic (formed at the
      same time). These mineral "guests" provide crucial evidence for identification and
      origin determination.

  - title: Corundum (Ruby & Sapphire)
    subsections:
      - title: Rutile Inclusions
        content: |
          Rutile (TiO2) is the most common solid inclusion in corundum:

          - **Short silk** - Fine, short needles (Burmese origin indicator)
          - **Long silk** - Longer needles at 60° angles (Sri Lankan indicator)
          - **Dense networks** - Heavy silk coverage (Thai/Cambodian stones)
          - **Dissolved silk** - Dotted remnants indicate heat treatment

  - title: Emerald Crystal Inclusions

      Emerald inclusions vary significantly by origin and provide key diagnostic evidence.

  - title: Diamond Crystal Inclusions
    content: |
      Diamond inclusions provide information about formation conditions deep in the
      Earth's mantle. They are syngenetic, crystallizing alongside the diamond.

      - title: Demantoid Garnet
        content: |
          Demantoid (andradite) from Russia shows the diagnostic "horsetail" inclusion:

          - **Horsetail**: Radiating fibres of byssolite (actinolite)
          - Fibres curve outward from central point
          - Diagnostic for Russian (Ural) demantoid
          - Namibian demantoid may lack horsetails

      - title: Tsavorite Garnet
        content: |
          Tsavorite (green grossular) from East Africa shows:

          - **Graphite plates**: Flat, dark inclusions
          - **Actinolite needles**: Elongated crystals
          - **Growth tubes**: Hollow channels
          - Generally cleaner than hessonite

      title: Using Crystal Inclusions
      text: |
        Crystal inclusions are particularly valuable because:

        1. **Species identification** - Certain inclusions are diagnostic
        2. **Origin determination** - Inclusion suites vary by locality
        3. **Natural vs synthetic** - Natural mineral inclusions prove natural origin
        4. **Treatment detection** - Heat treatment can alter or destroy inclusions

        Always document crystal inclusions with photographs at multiple magnifications.
