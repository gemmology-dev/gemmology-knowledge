      Inclusions are internal features that provide valuable information about a gem's
      identity, origin, and natural vs. synthetic status. They are a gem's "fingerprint."

  - title: Microscopy Techniques
    content: |
      Different lighting techniques reveal different inclusion types:

      - **Darkfield** - Best for seeing inclusions against dark background
      - **Brightfield** - Good for colour zoning and growth patterns
      - **Fibre-optic** - Pinpoint light for specific features
      - **Immersion** - Reduces surface reflections, reveals internal features
      - **Polarized light** - Shows strain patterns and twinning

      title: Best Practice
      text: |
        Always examine gems under magnification (10x minimum, 40-60x preferred)
        using multiple lighting techniques. Document findings with photographs
        when possible for comparison and records.

      title: Recording Inclusions
      text: |
        When documenting inclusions:

        1. **Describe location**: Crown, pavilion, near girdle, etc.
        2. **Note visibility**: Visible to naked eye or only under magnification
        3. **Identify type**: Crystal, feather, cloud, needle, etc.
        4. **Record effect**: Impact on transparency, durability, beauty
        5. **Photograph**: Multiple magnifications and lighting angles

        Systematic documentation creates valuable reference material for future
        comparisons and supports identification conclusions.
