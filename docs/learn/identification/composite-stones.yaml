      Composite stones (also called assembled stones) are made by joining two or more
      pieces of material together. Some composites are legitimate products (opal doublets
      for protection), while others are created to deceive buyers into thinking they
      have a solid, more valuable stone.

      Understanding composite construction and detection methods is essential for
      accurate gem identification and proper disclosure.

        - title: Doublets
          points:
            - Two pieces joined together
            - Crown and pavilion may differ
            - Glued or fused at junction
            - May have coloured cement
            - "Examples: opal doublet, garnet-top"
        - title: Triplets
          points:
            - Three pieces joined together
            - Thin slice between crown and pavilion
            - Protective cap on top
            - Base for support
            - "Examples: opal triplet, emerald triplet"

  - title: Doublets
    content: |
      Doublets consist of two pieces joined at a plane, typically at or near the girdle.
      The two parts may be different materials or the same material of different qualities.
    subsections:
      - title: Garnet-Topped Doublets
        content: |
          Historically common and often deceptive:

          - **Crown**: Thin slice of almandine garnet (hard, durable)
          - **Pavilion**: Coloured glass of any desired colour
          - **Join**: Fused together at high temperature

          Used to imitate ruby, sapphire, emerald, and other gems. The garnet provides
          hardness and natural RI while glass provides colour.

      - title: Opal Doublets
        content: |
          Legitimate products that protect thin opal and make it usable:

          - **Crown**: Thin slice of precious opal with play of colour
          - **Base**: Dark backing (potch, ironstone, or black glass)
          - **Purpose**: Makes thin opal usable; enhances colour contrast

          Properly disclosed opal doublets are acceptable commercial products.

      - title: Sapphire Doublets
        content: |
          - **Crown**: Colourless sapphire or synthetic sapphire
          - **Pavilion**: Blue synthetic sapphire or coloured material
          - **Join**: May contain coloured cement layer

          Creates appearance of fine blue sapphire using less valuable materials.

            - ["Jadeite doublet", "Thin jadeite slice", "Glass or plastic", "Enhance colour/size"]

  - title: Triplets
    content: |
      Triplets add a third component, often a protective cap or a thin coloured layer.
    subsections:
      - title: Opal Triplets
        content: |
          Most common triplet type:

          - **Cap**: Clear quartz or glass dome (protection)
          - **Middle**: Very thin slice of precious opal
          - **Base**: Dark backing (ironstone, black glass)

          The cap protects the delicate opal from damage and water. Properly disclosed
          opal triplets are legitimate products.

      - title: Emerald Triplets (Soudé)
        content: |
          "Soudé" (French for "soldered") emerald triplets:

          - **Crown**: Colourless beryl, quartz, or synthetic spinel
          - **Middle**: Green cement layer (creates colour)
          - **Pavilion**: Same as crown

          The only green is in the thin cement layer. Very deceptive when not disclosed.

      title: Soudé Emeralds
      text: |
        Soudé emerald triplets are particularly deceptive because:

        - They may show beryl RI readings
        - The green cement is only visible at the junction
        - When set, the join plane is hidden by the setting
        - Immersion is essential for detection

        Always examine green stones carefully in immersion before concluding they
        are natural emerald.

  - title: Detection Methods
    content: |
      Several techniques reveal composite stone structure.
    subsections:
      - title: Visual Examination
        content: |
          Look for:

          - **Junction line**: May be visible at girdle or under table
          - **Bubble layer**: Air bubbles trapped in cement
          - **Lustre difference**: Two parts may polish differently
          - **Colour concentration**: Colour only in one layer
          - **Transparency difference**: Parts may differ in clarity

      - title: Immersion Examination
        content: |
          Immersion in liquid (water, benzyl benzoate, or methylene iodide) reduces
          surface reflections and reveals internal structure:

          - **Join plane becomes visible**: Different RI materials show distinct boundary
          - **Colour distribution**: Shows if colour is only in cement
          - **Bubble plane**: Trapped air bubbles often visible
          - **RI differences**: Different parts refract differently

          Immersion is the most reliable method for detecting composites.

      - title: Profile Examination
        content: |
          View the stone from the side (profile view):

          - Join plane often visible at girdle level
          - Different materials may show different transparency
          - Colour concentration may be visible
          - Gap or cement layer may be apparent

  - title: Immersion Detection

      type: tip
      title: Immersion Best Practice
      text: |
        For composite detection:

        1. Use liquid with RI similar to the material (~1.54 for beryl/quartz)
        2. View stone from multiple angles
        3. Look for flat plane of colour or bubbles
        4. Check profile view for separation line
        5. Note any colour concentration differences

        Water (RI 1.33) works for initial screening; higher RI liquids provide clearer view.

  - title: Commercial Context

      Understanding when composites are legitimate vs deceptive is important.
    subsections:
      - title: Legitimate Uses
        content: |
          Composites are acceptable when:

          - **Properly disclosed**: Customer knows it's assembled
          - **Priced accordingly**: Reflects composite nature
          - **Serves purpose**: Protection (opal), extends use of material
          - **Clearly marked**: Documentation states "doublet" or "triplet"

      - title: Deceptive Practices
        content: |
          Composites are fraudulent when:

          - Sold as solid natural stones
          - Not disclosed at point of sale
          - Priced as natural equivalent
          - Concealed by mounting

          Non-disclosure of composite nature is fraud in most jurisdictions.

      - title: Disclosure Requirements
        content: |
          Composites must be identified as:

          - "Opal doublet" (not just "opal")
          - "Assembled stone"
          - "Composite stone"
          - With clear statement of construction

          CIBJO and FTC guidelines require disclosure of assembled nature.

      Composites in settings present challenges for detection.
    subsections:
      - title: Examination Challenges
        content: |
          Settings can hide:

          - Junction plane at girdle (covered by prongs)
          - Colour layer (closed back settings)
          - Backing material (bezel settings)

      - title: Examination Techniques
        content: |
          For mounted stones:

          - **Examine through table**: Look for bubble plane
          - **View pavilion**: If accessible, check for backing
          - **Side light**: Reveals internal planes
          - **Strong transmitted light**: May show structure
          - **Request removal**: For valuable stones, unmounting allows proper exam

      - title: Documentation
        content: |
          When composite status cannot be confirmed:

          - State "examination limited by mounting"
          - Recommend removal for complete testing
          - Note any suspicious features observed
          - Do not assume solid stone without verification
