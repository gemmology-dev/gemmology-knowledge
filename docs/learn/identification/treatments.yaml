  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Most coloured gemstones on the market today have undergone some form of treatment
      to enhance their appearance. Understanding treatments is essential for accurate
      identification and proper disclosure.
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Disclosure Requirement
      text: |
        All gemstone treatments must be disclosed at the point of sale. Major laboratories
        (GIA, Gubelin, SSEF) provide treatment reports. Undisclosed treatments are
        considered fraudulent.

  - title: Heat Treatment
    content: |
      The most common treatment, heat treatment permanently alters colour and clarity
      by modifying the chemical state of chromophores or dissolving silk inclusions.

    subsections:
      - title: Detection Signs
        content: |
          - Dissolved or partially dissolved silk (dotted lines)
          - Stress fractures around solid inclusions
          - Altered/melted inclusions
          - "Halo" fractures around zircon crystals
          - Colour concentrations along fractures
          - Altered absorption spectrum

  - title: Fracture Filling
    content: |
      Surface-reaching fractures are filled with glass, oil, or resin to improve
      apparent clarity. This treatment requires special care in handling.
    table:
      caption: Types of Fillers
      headers:
        - Filler Type
        - Gemstone
        - Stability

        - ["Polymer resins", "Various", "Variable"]
    subsections:
      - title: Detection Signs
        content: |
          - Flash effect (orange/blue flashes in fractures)
          - Gas bubbles in filler
          - Flow structures
          - Different RI in filled areas
          - Blue glow under UV (some resins)

  - title: Lead Glass-Filled Rubies
    callout:
      type: error
      title: Lead Glass-Filled Rubies
      text: |
        Heavily fractured, low-quality ruby is sometimes filled with high-RI lead glass.
        These stones can contain more glass than ruby and are extremely fragile. They
        are damaged by heat, ultrasonic cleaning, and even lemon juice.

  - title: Diffusion Treatment
    content: |
      Elements are diffused into the stone at high temperatures to alter colour.
      This can be shallow (surface) or deep (lattice diffusion).

      caption: Types of Diffusion
      headers:
        - Type
        - Element

        - ["Lattice diffusion", "Beryllium (Be)", "Orange/yellow/pink sapphire (deep)"]
        - ["Lattice diffusion", "Cobalt (Co)", "Blue glass-filled stones"]
    subsections:
      - title: Detection Methods
        content: |
          - **Surface diffusion**: Immersion reveals colour concentration along facet edges and girdle
          - **Beryllium diffusion**: LIBS or LA-ICP-MS analysis required for definitive detection
          - Colour distribution patterns may indicate treatment

  - title: HPHT Diamond Treatment
    content: |
      High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) treatment can permanently alter diamond colour.
      Originally developed for industrial applications, it's now used to improve gem-quality
      diamonds.
    subsections:
      - title: Type IIa Diamonds
        content: |
          Type IIa diamonds (nitrogen-free) can be decolourised by HPHT treatment:

          - **Starting material**: Brown Type IIa diamonds
          - **Result**: Near-colourless (D-F colour possible)
          - **Mechanism**: Removes plastic deformation that causes brown colour
          - **Stability**: Permanent; colour won't revert

      - title: Fancy Colour Creation
        table:
          headers:

            - ["Type IIa (brown)", "Colourless or pink", "Removes deformation"]
            - ["Type IIb", "Enhanced blue", "Possible but uncommon"]

      - title: Detection Methods
        content: |
          HPHT-treated diamonds can be identified by:

          - **Photoluminescence spectroscopy**: Characteristic centres
          - **Infrared spectroscopy**: Modified nitrogen aggregation
          - **DiamondView imaging**: Unusual fluorescence patterns
          - **Graining patterns**: May show altered internal structure
          - **Laboratory testing required**: Cannot be detected with standard tools

  - title: Cobalt Diffusion
    content: |
      Cobalt can be diffused into gems during high-temperature treatment, most commonly
      in lead glass-filled rubies where it creates artificial blue colour in the glass.
    subsections:
      - title: Cobalt in Glass-Filled Stones
        content: |
          Some lead glass fillings contain cobalt to add blue colour:

          - Creates bluish tinge that masks brown/orange body colours
          - Concentrated in fractures and surface areas
          - Can be mistaken for better quality material
          - Flash effect may show blue rather than typical orange

      - title: Detection
        content: |
          - **Blue flash effect**: Unusual blue colour in fractures under magnification
          - **Chelsea filter**: Strong red reaction from cobalt
          - **Spectroscopy**: Cobalt absorption bands (around 550nm)
          - **Chemical analysis**: LIBS or LA-ICP-MS confirms cobalt presence

    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Unstable Treatments
      text: |
        Some treatments require ongoing care or will degrade:

        - **Oil in emerald**: May dry out; requires periodic re-oiling
        - **Lead glass filling**: Extremely fragile; damaged by heat, acids, even lemon juice
        - **Coatings**: Will wear off; cannot be cleaned aggressively
        - **Some irradiation**: Certain colours may fade in light

        Always advise customers about care requirements for treated gems.

          1. Treater → dealer (must disclose)
          2. Dealer → retailer (must disclose)
          3. Retailer → consumer (must disclose)

          Failure at any point constitutes fraud or misrepresentation in most jurisdictions.
