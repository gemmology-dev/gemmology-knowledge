  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Synthetic gems have the same chemical composition, crystal structure, and physical
      properties as their natural counterparts. They are created in laboratories using
      various growth methods.

      title: Terminology
      text: |
        **Synthetic** - Same composition and structure as natural (lab-grown ruby is synthetic corundum)

        **Simulant** - Different material that resembles another (CZ simulates diamond)

        **Imitation** - Any material used to imitate another (glass "ruby")

  - title: Flame Fusion (Verneuil Process)
    content: |
      Invented in 1902, this is the oldest and most economical method. Powdered chemicals
      are dropped through a high-temperature flame, melting and crystallizing on a
      rotating pedestal.

          - Strontium titanate (diamond simulant)

  - title: Flux Growth
    content: |
      Crystals grow slowly from a molten flux solution at high temperatures. This produces
      high-quality crystals with natural-looking inclusions.

          - **Kyocera (Inamori)** - Emerald, ruby

  - title: Hydrothermal Growth

          - Emerald (Biron, Regency, Tairus)
          - Ruby and sapphire (some producers)

  - title: Czochralski (Pulling) Method
    content: |
      A seed crystal is dipped into molten material and slowly pulled upward, growing
      a single crystal. Used mainly for technical applications and some gem materials.

      - YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) - diamond simulant
      - GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) - diamond simulant
      - Alexandrite (Czochralski and floating zone)

      title: Professional Testing
      text: |
        While many synthetics can be identified with standard gemmological equipment,
        some high-quality synthetics and lab-grown diamonds require advanced laboratory
        testing (spectroscopy, photoluminescence imaging) for definitive identification.

  - title: Synthetic Moissanite
    content: |
      Synthetic moissanite (SiC, silicon carbide) is an important diamond simulant
      discovered to have gem potential in the 1990s.
    subsections:
      - title: Properties
        table:
          headers:
            - Property
            - Moissanite
            - Diamond

            - ["Chemical formula", "SiC", "C"]
            - ["Crystal system", "Hexagonal", "Cubic"]
            - ["Refractive index", "2.65-2.69", "2.417"]

            - ["Thermal conductivity", "High (490 W/m·K)", "Very high (2000+ W/m·K)"]

      - title: Detection Methods
        content: |
          Moissanite can be distinguished from diamond by:

          - **Doubling**: Strong birefringence shows facet doubling under magnification
          - **Electrical conductivity**: Moissanite conducts; diamond doesn't (except Type IIb)
          - **Specific gravity**: Lower than diamond (floats in 3.32 heavy liquid)
          - **Needle-like inclusions**: White, parallel needles common
          - **Thermal-electrical testers**: Dual-function testers identify moissanite

      - title: Market Position
        content: |
          Moissanite occupies a niche market:

          - Marketed as alternative to diamond, not simulant
          - Priced below diamond but above CZ
          - Ethical/environmental positioning
          - Own identity rather than diamond imitation

  - title: Synthetic Alexandrite
    content: |
      Synthetic alexandrite (colour-change chrysoberyl) is produced primarily by the
      Czochralski pulling method and flux growth.

            - Detection Features
          rows:
            - ["Czochralski", "Clean crystals, strong colour change", "Very clean; may have curved striae"]
            - ["Floating zone", "Similar to Czochralski", "Exceptionally clean"]
            - ["Flux growth", "Natural-looking inclusions", "Flux veils, metallic platelets"]

      - title: Comparison with Natural
        content: |
          Natural alexandrite is extremely rare; most "alexandrite" in the market is synthetic
          or colour-change sapphire.

          **Natural alexandrite features:**
          - Chrysoberyl inclusions
          - Three-phase inclusions
          - Irregular colour distribution

          **Synthetic alexandrite features:**
          - Very clean (Czochralski)
          - Flux inclusions if flux-grown
          - Strong, consistent colour change
