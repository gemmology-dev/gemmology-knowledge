  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      The polariscope uses two polarising filters to determine a gem's optical character
      (isotropic vs. anisotropic) and can reveal strain, twinning, and anomalous double
      refraction (ADR).

      This simple but powerful instrument quickly sorts gems into fundamental optical
      categories, guiding further testing.

  - title: Components and Setup
    content: |
      A polariscope consists of:
    subsections:
      - title: Basic Components
        content: |
          - **Polariser**: Lower filter, fixed position
          - **Analyser**: Upper filter, can rotate
          - **Light source**: Below the polariser
          - **Stone platform**: Between the two filters

      - title: Crossed Polars Position
        content: |
          When the polariser and analyser are at 90° to each other, light cannot
          pass through—the field appears dark. This is the "crossed polars" position
          used for most tests.

          When aligned parallel, maximum light passes through (bright field).

  - title: Basic Optic Character Test

      Place the gem between crossed polars and rotate it 360°:

      headers:
        - Observation
        - Interpretation
        - Examples
      rows:
        - ["Remains dark during rotation", "Isotropic (cubic system or amorphous)", "Diamond, spinel, garnet, glass"]
        - ["Light and dark every 90° (4× blink)", "Anisotropic (crystalline, non-cubic)", "Quartz, tourmaline, corundum, beryl"]
        - ["Remains light (never dark)", "Aggregate or microcrystalline material", "Jade (jadeite/nephrite), chalcedony"]
        - ["Patchy light/dark (tabby extinction)", "ADR or strain birefringence", "Strained garnet, synthetic spinel"]

  - title: Anomalous Double Refraction (ADR)
    content: |
      Some isotropic materials show strain birefringence due to internal stress:
    subsections:
      - title: What Is ADR?
        content: |
          Anomalous double refraction appears as irregular light patches that don't follow
          the normal 4× blink pattern. The stone may show:

          - **Tabby extinction**: Cross-hatched or patchy pattern
          - **Roiled effect**: Swirling patterns
          - **Partial extinction**: Some areas dark, others light

      - title: Gems Showing ADR
        table:
          headers:
            - Gem
            - ADR Character
            - Notes
          rows:
            - ["Garnet (especially almandine)", "Common, often strong", "Due to rapid growth or thermal stress"]
            - ["Spinel", "Occasional", "More common in synthetics"]
            - ["Diamond", "Can show strain patterns", "May indicate Type IIa"]
            - ["Glass", "Often shows strain", "From cooling stresses"]
            - ["Synthetic spinel", "Very common", "Diagnostic feature"]

      - title: Distinguishing ADR from True DR
        content: |
          True double refraction (anisotropic):
          - Regular 4× extinction pattern
          - Consistent across the stone
          - Shows on refractometer as two readings

          Anomalous double refraction:
          - Irregular, patchy extinction
          - Often localised areas
          - Single reading on refractometer

  - title: Conoscopic Observation (Interference Figures)
    content: |
      With magnification and proper technique, the polariscope can reveal
      interference figures that indicate uniaxial or biaxial character.
    subsections:
      - title: Setting Up
        content: |
          1. Use a converging light source (add condensing lens)
          2. Position the stone with optic axis vertical
          3. View through magnifying lens above analyser
          4. Look for characteristic interference patterns

      - title: Uniaxial Figure
        content: |
          Uniaxial crystals (trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal) show:

          - **Cross pattern**: Dark cross (isogyres) on coloured rings
          - **Centred optic axis**: Cross stays stationary during rotation
          - **Off-centre**: Cross arms sweep through field

          The cross indicates viewing down or near the optic axis.

      - title: Biaxial Figure
        content: |
          Biaxial crystals (orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic) show:

          - **Two melatopes**: Points where optic axes emerge
          - **Curved isogyres**: Dark bands curve as stone rotates
          - **2V angle**: Separation indicates biaxial character

      - title: Practical Limitations
        content: |
          Obtaining clear interference figures can be difficult:

          - Requires specific orientation
          - Stone must be relatively clean
          - Takes practice to interpret
          - Not always achievable in cut stones

  - title: Twinning Detection
    content: |
      The polariscope can reveal crystal twinning:
    subsections:
      - title: How Twins Appear
        content: |
          Twinned crystals have domains with different optical orientations:

          - **Lamellar twinning**: Parallel striations that blink at different positions
          - **Contact twins**: Sharp boundary between regions
          - **Penetration twins**: Interpenetrating domains

      - title: Diagnostic Twinning
        table:
          headers:
            - Gem
            - Twinning Type
            - Appearance
          rows:
            - ["Corundum", "Polysynthetic", "Fine parallel lamellae; rhombohedral"]
            - ["Quartz", "Brazil/Dauphiné", "Sectors may show differently"]
            - ["Feldspar", "Albite twinning", "Parallel striations"]
            - ["Calcite", "Polysynthetic", "Parallel lamellae"]
            - ["Spinel", "Contact twins", "Octahedral habit"]

      type: info
      title: What Strain Indicates
      text: |
        Strain patterns visible in the polariscope can indicate:

        - **Natural formation stress**: Common in many gems
        - **Heat treatment evidence**: May show altered strain patterns
        - **Synthetic origin**: Different strain from natural growth
        - **Structural weakness**: Heavy strain may affect durability

        While strain alone is rarely diagnostic, it provides useful supporting evidence.

  - title: Maintenance and Care
    content: |
      Polariscope maintenance is straightforward:

      - Keep polarising filters clean and scratch-free
      - Store in dust-free environment
      - Check light source regularly
      - Handle filters by edges only
      - Avoid exposing filters to extreme heat
