  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      The dichroscope reveals pleochroism by showing two polarised images side by side.
      It's essential for identifying coloured anisotropic gems and can help distinguish
      natural from synthetic materials.

      Pleochroism—the property of showing different colours in different crystallographic
      directions—is diagnostic for many coloured gemstones.

  - title: Types of Dichroscope
    content: |
      Two main types are available:
    subsections:
      - title: Calcite Dichroscope
        content: |
          Uses a calcite rhomb (Iceland spar) to split the image:

          - **More accurate**: Clear separation of colours
          - **Traditional choice**: Preferred by professionals
          - **Higher cost**: More expensive than polaroid type
          - **Fragile**: Calcite can cleave if dropped

      - title: Polaroid Dichroscope
        content: |
          Uses polarising film to create two windows:

          - **More affordable**: Lower cost option
          - **Durable**: Less fragile than calcite
          - **Good for field use**: Compact and rugged
          - **Slightly less clear**: Colours may be slightly muted

  - title: Usage Technique
    content: |
      Proper technique is essential for accurate results:
    subsections:
      - title: Basic Procedure
        content: |
          1. View the gem through the dichroscope with strong transmitted light
          2. Rotate the dichroscope (not the gem) while observing
          3. Look for colour differences between the two images
          4. Rotate the gem to find the direction of maximum colour difference
          5. Record both colours seen

      - title: Tips for Best Results
        content: |
          - Use a strong, white light source
          - View through the body of the stone, not the surface
          - Check multiple directions (rotate the gem 90°)
          - Compare colours side by side in the two windows
          - Work with good eye relief (don't press against eyepiece)

  - title: Interpreting Results
    table:
      headers:
        - Observation
        - Interpretation
        - Example Gems
      rows:
        - ["Two identical colours", "Isotropic or viewing down optic axis", "Spinel, garnet, glass"]
        - ["Two different colours (dichroism)", "Uniaxial gem (trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal)", "Ruby, sapphire, tourmaline"]
        - ["Three colours visible (trichroism)", "Biaxial gem (orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic)", "Tanzanite, alexandrite, iolite"]
        - ["No colour visible", "Colourless or very pale stone", "Colourless topaz, pale beryl"]

  - title: Pleochroism Strength
    content: |
      Pleochroism varies from very weak to very strong:
    subsections:
      - title: Strength Scale
        content: |
          - **None**: Isotropic materials (no pleochroism)
          - **Weak**: Slight colour variation, difficult to see
          - **Distinct**: Clear difference but moderate
          - **Strong**: Obvious colour difference
          - **Very strong**: Dramatic colour change between directions

      - title: Factors Affecting Visibility
        content: |
          - **Colour saturation**: Pale stones show less pleochroism
          - **Viewing direction**: Maximum difference perpendicular to optic axis
          - **Light quality**: Strong, white light shows colours best
          - **Stone size**: Larger stones show colours more clearly

      Understanding the distinction:
    subsections:
      - title: Dichroic Gems (Uniaxial)
        content: |
          Uniaxial crystals have two principal optical directions and show
          two pleochroic colours. These belong to:

          - Trigonal system (corundum, tourmaline, quartz)
          - Tetragonal system (zircon, scapolite)
          - Hexagonal system (beryl, apatite)

      - title: Trichroic Gems (Biaxial)
        content: |
          Biaxial crystals have three principal optical directions and can
          show three distinct pleochroic colours. These belong to:

          - Orthorhombic system (topaz, peridot, tanzanite)
          - Monoclinic system (kunzite, diopside)
          - Triclinic system (kyanite)

          To see all three colours, rotate the gem to view along different axes.

      title: When Pleochroism Matters
      text: |
        The dichroscope is particularly useful for:

        - **Separating ruby from garnet**: Ruby shows strong pleochroism; garnet shows none
        - **Confirming corundum identity**: Characteristic pleochroic colours
        - **Identifying iolite**: Very strong trichroism is diagnostic
        - **Detecting synthetics**: Some synthetics show atypical pleochroism
        - **Assessing cutting orientation**: Colour face-up depends on cut direction

  - title: Common Mistakes
    content: |
      Avoid these errors when using the dichroscope:

      - **Rotating the gem instead of the dichroscope** initially
      - **Using reflected light** instead of transmitted light
      - **Not checking multiple directions** in the stone
      - **Confusing colour zoning** with pleochroism
      - **Testing opaque or heavily included stones** (no light transmission)
