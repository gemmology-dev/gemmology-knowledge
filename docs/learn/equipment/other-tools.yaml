  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Beyond the core gemmological instruments, several supporting tools provide
      valuable identification assistance. These range from quick screening devices
      to precise measurement equipment.

      Each tool has specific applications where it excels, contributing to the
      comprehensive approach needed for accurate gem identification.

  - title: The Chelsea Filter
    content: |
      The Chelsea filter transmits only deep red and yellow-green light. It was designed
      to distinguish Colombian emerald (appears red) from its simulants.
    subsections:
      - title: How It Works
        content: |
          The filter absorbs most wavelengths, transmitting only:

          - **Deep red** (~690nm)
          - **Yellow-green** (~570nm)

          Chromium-coloured gems transmit red light and appear **pink to red**.
          Non-chromium green gems absorb red and appear **green or grey**.

      - title: Historical Context
        content: |
          Named after the Chelsea Polytechnic in London where it was developed
          in the 1930s. Originally intended to separate Colombian emeralds from
          green glass imitations.

      title: Important Limitations
      text: |
        The Chelsea filter is NOT diagnostic for emerald!

        - Synthetic emeralds also appear red (often more so)
        - Some natural emeralds (Zambian) may not show strong red
        - Cobalt-coloured gems appear red
        - Always use additional tests: RI, inclusions, spectrum

        The filter is a screening tool, not a definitive test.

  - title: Thermal Conductivity Probes
    content: |
      Thermal probes measure how quickly heat is conducted away from a heated tip
      placed on the gem's surface.
    subsections:
      - title: How They Work
        content: |
          - A heated probe tip touches the gem surface
          - Sensor measures rate of heat dissipation
          - Diamond conducts heat extremely rapidly
          - Most simulants conduct heat much more slowly

      - title: Diamond Testing
        content: |
          Diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of any gemstone:

          - **Diamond**: Extremely high conductivity; meter reads "diamond"
          - **Moissanite**: Also high conductivity (problem!)
          - **CZ, glass, etc.**: Low conductivity; clearly distinguished from diamond

      - title: The Moissanite Problem
        content: |
          Synthetic moissanite (silicon carbide) has thermal conductivity close to
          diamond, so basic thermal probes cannot distinguish them.

          **Solution**: Dual testers that measure both thermal and electrical
          conductivity. Moissanite is electrically conductive; diamond is not
          (except rare Type IIb blue diamonds).

      headers:
        - Type
        - Measures
        - Distinguishes
        - Limitation
      rows:
        - ["Basic thermal", "Heat conductivity only", "Diamond from CZ, glass, simulants", "Cannot separate diamond from moissanite"]
        - ["Dual tester", "Thermal + electrical", "Diamond from all simulants including moissanite", "Type IIb diamonds may give false reading"]
        - ["Multi-tester", "Multiple properties", "Broad screening capability", "Higher cost; requires training"]

  - title: Specific Gravity Measurement
    content: |
      Specific gravity (relative density) is measured using hydrostatic weighing,
      comparing weight in air to weight suspended in water.
    subsections:
      - title: Hydrostatic Method
        content: |
          The classic method using Archimedes' principle:

          1. Weigh stone in air (W₁)
          2. Weigh stone suspended in water (W₂)
          3. Calculate: SG = W₁ / (W₁ - W₂)

          Requires a precision balance with suspension setup.

      - title: Equipment Required
        content: |
          - **Precision balance**: 0.01g resolution minimum
          - **Suspension bridge**: Holds stone in water
          - **Container**: Deep enough for complete immersion
          - **Clean water**: Distilled or deionised, room temperature
          - **Tweezers**: For handling small stones

      - title: Practical Considerations
        content: |
          - Remove air bubbles from stone surface
          - Use room temperature water
          - Account for any drilling or inclusions
          - Porous stones may absorb water
          - Very small stones are difficult to measure accurately

          title: Heavy Liquid Hazards
          text: |
            Most heavy liquids are toxic and/or carcinogenic:

            - Use in well-ventilated areas or fume hoods
            - Wear appropriate protective equipment
            - Never mouth-pipette
            - Store properly and dispose as hazardous waste

            Many laboratories now avoid heavy liquids due to safety concerns.

  - title: The 10× Loupe
    content: |
      The hand loupe remains essential for field work and quick examination:
    subsections:
      - title: Choosing a Loupe
        content: |
          - **10× magnification**: Industry standard (FGA, GIA grading)
          - **Triplet lens**: Corrected for distortion
          - **Quality optics**: Clear, sharp image to edge
          - **Adequate working distance**: ~25mm

      - title: Loupe Technique
        content: |
          1. Hold loupe close to your eye
          2. Bring stone up to loupe (not loupe to stone)
          3. Find optimal distance for focus (~25mm)
          4. Use good lighting (overhead or from behind you)
          5. Steady both hands against each other or face

      - title: What to Look For
        content: |
          A quick loupe examination reveals:

          - Surface condition (scratches, chips, wear)
          - Obvious inclusions
          - Doubling of back facets (high birefringence)
          - Junction of doublet/triplet layers
          - Overall cut quality and symmetry

  - title: Colour Reference Stones
    content: |
      Master stones and colour references ensure consistent grading:

      - **Diamond master sets**: GIA-graded stones for D-Z scale
      - **Coloured stone references**: For hue comparison
      - **Munsell colour system**: Standardised colour notation
      - **Gem colour charts**: Printed references (approximations only)
