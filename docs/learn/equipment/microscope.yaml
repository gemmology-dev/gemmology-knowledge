  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      The gemmological microscope is essential for studying inclusions, growth features,
      and signs of treatment. Magnifications from 10× to 60× are typically used, with
      various illumination techniques revealing different internal features.

      Microscopy skills are fundamental to separating natural from synthetic gems and
      detecting many treatments.

  - title: Microscope Types
    content: |
      Several microscope configurations are used in gemmology:
    subsections:
      - title: Stereo Microscope
        content: |
          The standard gemmological microscope:

          - **Binocular viewing**: Comfortable, natural depth perception
          - **Variable magnification**: Usually 10× to 45×
          - **Working distance**: Adequate space for manipulation
          - **Various illumination options**: Darkfield, brightfield, fibre-optic

      - title: Compound Microscope
        content: |
          Higher magnification for detailed work:

          - **Higher power**: 100× to 400×
          - **Thinner depth of field**: More difficult to use
          - **Specific applications**: Examining very fine inclusions
          - **Not standard** for routine gemmology

  - title: Magnification Ranges
    content: |
      Different magnifications serve different purposes:

        - ["20×", "General inclusion observation", "Good balance of magnification and field"]

      Different lighting reveals different features:

        - Best For
      rows:
        - ["Darkfield", "Light from sides; inclusions bright against dark background", "Most inclusions, three-phase, silk"]

  - title: Darkfield Illumination
    content: |
      The most commonly used technique:
    subsections:
      - title: How It Works
        content: |
          Light enters from the sides rather than directly below:

          - Background appears dark
          - Inclusions scatter light and appear bright
          - Excellent contrast for most internal features
          - Standard setup for routine examination

      - title: What It Reveals
        content: |
          - Crystal inclusions (bright points or shapes)
          - Silk and needle inclusions
          - Gas bubbles
          - Fractures and feathers
          - Fingerprints (healed fractures)
          - Three-phase inclusions

      Alternative illumination for specific observations:
    subsections:
      - title: Brightfield
        content: |
          Light transmitted directly through the stone:

          - **Colour zoning**: Visible as bands or areas of different colour
          - **Growth patterns**: Hexagonal zoning in corundum
          - **Colour concentration**: Around fractures or surfaces
          - **Best for**: Transparent stones with colour variations

      - title: Fibre-Optic Illumination
        content: |
          Directed light for specific features:

          - Pinpoint individual inclusions
          - Trace fractures and feathers
          - Examine drill holes
          - Light difficult-to-reach areas

      - title: Oblique and Shadow Illumination
        content: |
          Light at steep angles:

          - Enhances surface texture
          - Reveals polish quality
          - Shows surface-reaching features
          - Highlights laser drill holes

  - title: Immersion Technique
    content: |
      Immersing the gem in a liquid of similar RI reduces surface reflections and reveals
      internal features more clearly.

            - ["Clove oil", "1.54", "General purpose", "Pleasant odour; low toxicity"]

      - title: Immersion Observations
        content: |
          Immersion reveals:

          - **Colour zoning**: Much clearer than in air
          - **Growth patterns**: Curved (synthetic) vs angular (natural)
          - **Surface treatments**: Diffusion layers
          - **Internal features**: Without surface reflections

      title: Safety and Stone Precautions
      text: |
        When using immersion liquids:

        - **Avoid porous stones**: Turquoise, opal, pearls may be damaged
        - **Use gloves**: Especially with methylene iodide
        - **Ventilate**: Some liquids have hazardous vapours
        - **Clean stones**: Remove all liquid after examination
        - **Don't immerse**: Doublets, triplets, or filled stones

      Certain inclusions are diagnostic for species or origin:

      - title: Natural vs Synthetic
        content: |
          Key differences to look for:

          - **Natural**: Irregular growth, natural crystal inclusions
          - **Flame fusion**: Gas bubbles, curved striae
          - **Flux synthetic**: Flux inclusions, platinum crystals
          - **Hydrothermal**: Seed plate, chevron patterns

  - title: Treatment Detection
    content: |
      The microscope is essential for treatment detection:

      - **Heat treatment**: Altered silk, stress fractures, melted inclusions
      - **Fracture filling**: Flash effect, gas bubbles in filler
      - **Lead glass filling**: Flash effect, trapped bubbles
      - **Beryllium diffusion**: Colour concentration at facet junctions
      - **Laser drilling**: Thin tubes reaching inclusions
      - **Coating**: Iridescence, colour concentration at surface
