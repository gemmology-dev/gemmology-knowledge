      Gemmological testing relies on a suite of standard instruments that measure optical and
      physical properties. Mastering these tools is fundamental to gem identification and
      forms the core practical skills tested in the FGA Foundation examination.

      A systematic approach using multiple instruments provides the most reliable identification.
      No single test is definitive—results should be correlated across several methods.

      title: Systematic Testing Approach
      text: |
        For unknown gems, follow this sequence:

        1. **Visual examination**: Colour, transparency, lustre, cut style
        2. **Refractometer**: RI and birefringence
        3. **Polariscope**: Optic character (SR/DR)
        4. **Dichroscope**: Pleochroism (if coloured and DR)
        5. **Microscope**: Inclusions, growth features
        6. **Spectroscope**: Absorption spectrum
        7. **UV lamp**: Fluorescence reactions
        8. **Chelsea filter**: If green stone
        9. **SG**: If refractometer inconclusive or OTL

        Document all results before reaching a conclusion.

      title: Stones Above Refractometer Limits
      text: |
        Stones with RI above 1.81 cannot be measured on standard refractometers:

        - **Diamond** (RI 2.417) - Use thermal probe or specific gravity
        - **Zircon** (RI 1.93–1.98) - May show partial reading
        - **Demantoid** (RI 1.88) - SG and spectrum for identification
        - **Sphene** (RI 1.90–2.02) - Identify by high dispersion and birefringence

  - title: Recording and Documentation

      Accurate documentation is essential for professional practice:
    subsections:
      - title: What to Record
        content: |
          For each stone examined, document:

          - **Date and reference number**
          - **Description**: Weight, dimensions, cut style, colour
          - **All test results**: RI, optic character, pleochroism, spectrum, fluorescence
          - **Inclusions observed**: With photomicrographs if possible
          - **Conclusion**: Identification with confidence level

      - title: Professional Standards
        content: |
          Follow these documentation principles:

          - Record observations objectively, without interpretation bias
          - Note any limitations or uncertainties
          - Keep equipment calibration records
          - Maintain chain of custody for valuable items
          - Store records securely with appropriate confidentiality
