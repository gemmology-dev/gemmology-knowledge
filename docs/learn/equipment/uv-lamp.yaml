  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Ultraviolet fluorescence can be diagnostic for certain gems and treatments.
      Two wavelengths are used: long-wave (LWUV, 365nm) and short-wave (SWUV, 254nm).
      Different gems may react differently to each wavelength.

      While rarely definitive alone, UV testing provides valuable supporting evidence
      for identification.

  - title: LWUV vs SWUV
    content: |
      Understanding the two wavelengths:
    subsections:
      - title: Long-Wave UV (LWUV, 365nm)
        content: |
          - **Safer**: Less harmful to eyes
          - **Penetrates deeper**: May show internal reactions
          - **Often stronger reactions**: Many gems fluoresce more to LWUV
          - **Common light sources**: LED-based lamps, Wood's lamps

      - title: Short-Wave UV (SWUV, 254nm)
        content: |
          - **More diagnostic**: Different reactions from LWUV
          - **Surface reactions**: Less penetration
          - **Requires eye protection**: Can damage eyes
          - **Requires special tubes**: Mercury vapour lamps

      - title: Why Use Both
        content: |
          Testing with both wavelengths is important because:

          - Some gems fluoresce only to one wavelength
          - Different colours may appear under each
          - The pattern of LWUV vs SWUV reaction can be diagnostic
          - Treatments may show different reactions to each

  - title: Testing Procedure
    content: |
      For accurate fluorescence observation:
    subsections:
      - title: Setup Requirements
        content: |
          - **Complete darkness**: Essential for accurate observation
          - **UV cabinet or darkroom**: Blocks ambient light
          - **Clean gems**: Oils and dirt can fluoresce
          - **White background**: For consistent observation

      - title: Observation Protocol
        content: |
          1. Place gem on white paper in darkness
          2. Observe under LWUV first (safer)
          3. Note colour, intensity, and distribution
          4. Switch to SWUV (use eye protection)
          5. Note any differences from LWUV
          6. Check for phosphorescence after UV removed
          7. Document all observations

      - title: Describing Fluorescence
        content: |
          Record fluorescence systematically:

          - **Colour**: Blue, red, yellow, green, orange, white
          - **Intensity**: Inert, weak, moderate, strong, very strong
          - **Distribution**: Even, patchy, zoned
          - **LWUV vs SWUV**: Note differences

  - title: Safety Considerations
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: UV Safety
      text: |
        UV light requires careful handling:

        - **Never look directly at UV light source**
        - **Wear UV-blocking glasses**, especially with SWUV
        - **Limit exposure time** to both you and the gems
        - **Keep children away** from UV equipment
        - **SWUV is particularly hazardous**: Can cause corneal burns

        Even brief SWUV exposure can damage eyes. Always use appropriate protection.

  - title: Phosphorescence
    content: |
      Some gems continue glowing after UV light is removed:
    subsections:
      - title: What Is Phosphorescence?
        content: |
          Phosphorescence is delayed fluorescence—the gem continues to emit light
          for seconds to minutes after the UV source is removed.

          This "afterglow" can be diagnostic for certain materials.

      Practical applications of UV testing:
    subsections:
      - title: Natural vs Synthetic
        content: |
          - **Synthetic ruby**: Usually stronger fluorescence than natural
          - **Synthetic emerald**: May fluoresce red (natural usually inert)
          - **Synthetic spinel**: Strong blue-white fluorescence

      - title: Treatment Detection
        content: |
          - **Glass filling**: May fluoresce differently from host
          - **Polymer treatment**: Some polymers fluoresce
          - **Coating detection**: Coating may have different reaction

      - title: Diamond Screening
        content: |
          Fluorescence helps with diamond identification:

          - Strong blue fluorescence suggests natural Type Ia
          - Unusual colours may indicate treatment or synthetic
          - CVD diamonds often show orange fluorescence
          - HPHT-treated may show different patterns

  - title: Limitations
    content: |
      UV testing has important limitations:

      - **Not definitive**: Similar gems may show similar reactions
      - **Variable within species**: Not all specimens react the same
      - **Affected by treatments**: Some treatments alter fluorescence
      - **Dirty surfaces**: Can give false readings
      - **Coloured stones**: Body colour may mask weak fluorescence
