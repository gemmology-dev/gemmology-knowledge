  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      The spectroscope displays the absorption spectrum of a gem, showing which wavelengths
      of light are absorbed. Certain absorption patterns are diagnostic for specific gems
      and treatments, making this an essential identification tool.

      While requiring more skill than basic instruments, the spectroscope provides
      information unavailable from any other portable tool.

  - title: Types of Spectroscope
    content: |
      Two main types are used in gemmology:
    subsections:
      - title: Prism Spectroscope
        content: |
          Uses a prism to disperse light into its spectrum:

          - **Better resolution in red**: Red end of spectrum spread more
          - **Compressed blue end**: Blue/violet more difficult to read
          - **Traditional choice**: Many gemmologists prefer prism type
          - **Wavelength scale**: May be non-linear due to prism dispersion

      - title: Diffraction Grating Spectroscope
        content: |
          Uses a diffraction grating to create the spectrum:

          - **Even spread**: Spectrum evenly distributed
          - **Easier wavelength estimation**: More linear scale
          - **Good for learning**: Easier to correlate with reference charts
          - **May have multiple orders**: Secondary spectra visible

  - title: Setup and Technique
    content: |
      Proper setup is critical for useful observations:
    subsections:
      - title: Light Source Requirements
        content: |
          - Strong white light (incandescent preferred)
          - Light transmitted through the gem
          - Position slit close to the stone
          - Avoid ambient light interference

      - title: Viewing Procedure
        content: |
          1. Illuminate the gem with strong transmitted light
          2. Position the spectroscope slit close to the stone
          3. Focus the eyepiece on the spectrum
          4. Allow eyes to adapt (30 seconds to 1 minute)
          5. Look for dark lines or bands against the coloured spectrum
          6. Note position (wavelength in nm) and width of features

      - title: Recording Observations
        content: |
          Document findings systematically:

          - **Lines**: Sharp, narrow features (atomic absorption)
          - **Bands**: Broader absorption regions
          - **Cut-off**: Absorption of entire spectral region (e.g., blue cut-off)
          - **Position**: Wavelength in nanometres (nm)
          - **Intensity**: Weak, moderate, strong

  - title: Chromophore Absorption Patterns
    content: |
      Different colour-causing elements produce characteristic spectra:
    subsections:
      - title: Chromium (Cr³⁺)
        content: |
          Produces red colour with characteristic features:

          - **Doublet at 694nm**: Very close pair of lines in deep red
          - **Lines at 668, 659nm**: Additional absorption in red
          - **Broad absorption in yellow-green**: Creates red colour
          - **Found in**: Ruby, emerald, red spinel, alexandrite, chrome tourmaline

      - title: Iron (Fe)

          - **Fe³⁺**: Produces yellow-brown colours; sharp lines
          - **Fe²⁺-Fe³⁺ charge transfer**: Intense blue (sapphire)

      title: Improving Your Technique
      text: |
        To see spectra more clearly:

        - **Dark adapt your eyes** before observing
        - **Start with strongly coloured stones** to learn patterns
        - **Use reference spectra** for comparison
        - **Practice with known materials** before unknowns
        - **Note both presence AND absence** of expected features
        - **Compare with similar species** to note differences

  - title: Treatment Detection
    content: |
      The spectroscope can reveal certain treatments:
    subsections:
      - title: Heat Treatment Signs
        content: |
          - **Modified absorption patterns** in some treated stones
          - **Reduced Fe bands** in heated sapphires
          - **Changed colour centre absorption**

      - title: Diffusion Treatment
        content: |
          - **Surface-related absorption** (best seen immersed)
          - **Unusual colour distribution**

      - title: Dyed Materials
        content: |
          - **Atypical absorption patterns**
          - **Absorption inconsistent with body colour**
          - **Unusual dye bands**

  - title: Limitations
    content: |
      Be aware of spectroscope limitations:

      - Requires adequate light transmission
      - Very pale stones show weak spectra
      - Small stones are difficult to examine
      - Takes practice to interpret patterns
      - Some gem species show no diagnostic spectrum
      - Laboratory spectrometers provide more detailed analysis
