  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      The refractometer is the most important gemmological instrument. It measures refractive
      index (RI) by observing the critical angle of total internal reflection at the
      gem-to-glass interface.

      Refractive index is a fundamental property that helps identify gem species and can
      distinguish between similar-looking materials.

  - title: How It Works
    content: |
      Light enters through the gemstone placed on a high-RI glass hemisphere. At angles
      greater than the critical angle, light is totally internally reflected, creating
      a shadow edge on the scale. This edge corresponds to the gem's RI.
    subsections:
      - title: Components
        content: |
          A standard gemmological refractometer includes:

          - **High-RI glass hemisphere**: Typically RI ~1.86
          - **Contact liquid** (RI ~1.81): Bridges the gap between gem and glass
          - **Scale**: Range typically 1.35–1.81
          - **Light source**: Monochromatic sodium yellow (589nm) for accurate readings
          - **Eyepiece**: For viewing the scale and shadow edge

      - title: Critical Angle Principle
        content: |
          When light travels from a denser to less dense medium, it refracts away from
          the normal. At the critical angle, light travels along the interface. Beyond
          this angle, total internal reflection occurs.

          The position of the shadow edge on the scale directly indicates the critical
          angle and therefore the refractive index.

  - title: Faceted Stone Technique
    content: |
      For faceted stones, the standard technique provides accurate RI measurements:
    subsections:
      - title: Procedure
        content: |
          1. Place a small drop of contact liquid on the hemisphere
          2. Position the stone table-down on the liquid
          3. Look through the eyepiece at the scale
          4. Rotate the stone to find maximum and minimum RI readings
          5. For uniaxial stones: two readings (omega and epsilon)
          6. For biaxial stones: three readings (alpha, beta, gamma) but only two visible at once

      - title: Reading the Scale
        content: |
          - **Shadow edge**: Sharp boundary between light and dark regions
          - **Single reading**: Isotropic material (cubic or amorphous)
          - **Two readings**: Anisotropic material; difference is birefringence
          - **Moving readings**: Indicates high birefringence; rotate to find limits

      - title: Birefringence Calculation
        content: |
          Birefringence = Higher RI - Lower RI

          For example:
          - Quartz: 1.553 - 1.544 = 0.009
          - Tourmaline: 1.640 - 1.620 = 0.020
          - Zircon (high): 1.984 - 1.931 = 0.053

  - title: Cabochon (Spot Reading) Technique
    content: |
      For curved surfaces, use the spot method:
    subsections:
      - title: Procedure
        content: |
          1. Use minimum contact liquid
          2. Place the curved surface on the hemisphere
          3. Look for a spot of light rather than a shadow edge
          4. The spot's position on the scale indicates approximate RI
          5. Rock the stone gently to centre the spot

      - title: Limitations
        content: |
          - Less accurate than faceted readings (+/- 0.01)
          - Useful for rough assessment of cabochons and beads
          - Cannot measure birefringence accurately
          - Best for isotropic materials or quick screening

      rows:
        - ["No reading visible", "RI above contact liquid limit (>1.81)", "Use SG or other tests; stone may be diamond, zircon, etc."]
        - ["Fuzzy edge", "Birefringent stone, dirty contact, poor polish", "Clean surface; rotate stone; check polish"]
        - ["Moving readings", "High birefringence", "Rotate and record both extreme values"]
        - ["Very faint reading", "Poor lighting or positioning", "Improve lighting; reposition stone"]
        - ["Multiple edges", "Doubly refractive viewing down optic axis", "Rotate stone to find clearest readings"]

      title: Handling Contact Liquid
      text: |
        Standard contact liquid (methylene iodide, RI ~1.74-1.81) requires careful handling:

        - **Toxic**: Avoid skin contact and inhalation
        - **Light sensitive**: Store in dark bottles
        - **Staining**: Can discolour skin and porous stones
        - **Alternatives**: Safer liquids available (RI ~1.79) with slightly lower range

        Always wash hands after use and ensure good ventilation.

  - title: Maintenance
    content: |
      Proper maintenance ensures accurate readings:
    subsections:
      - title: Daily Care
        content: |
          - Clean hemisphere with soft cloth after each use
          - Remove all contact liquid residue
          - Check light source is working properly
          - Store in protective case when not in use

      - title: Calibration Check
        content: |
          Periodically verify accuracy using known materials:

          - **Quartz**: 1.544-1.553
          - **Fluorite**: 1.434 (isotropic)
          - **Spinel**: 1.718 (isotropic)

          If readings are consistently off, the instrument may need professional calibration.
