  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Professional gemmology extends beyond identification skills to encompass ethical
      practice, accurate communication, and legal responsibilities. A professional
      gemmologist must balance technical accuracy with clear communication, maintaining
      integrity while serving clients, trade, and public trust.

      This module covers the professional standards, documentation practices, and
      ethical frameworks that define quality gemmological practice.

  - title: Report Writing
    content: |
      Gemmological reports must be accurate, clear, and legally defensible. Whether
      a brief identification note or comprehensive laboratory report, certain standards
      apply.
    subsections:
      - title: Report Structure
        content: |
          A comprehensive gemmological report typically includes:

          1. **Header**: Laboratory name, report number, date
          2. **Item description**: Weight, dimensions, shape, cut
          3. **Identification**: Species, variety, natural/synthetic
          4. **Properties measured**: RI, SG, optic character
          5. **Inclusions/features**: Brief description of significant features
          6. **Treatment status**: Detected treatments or "none detected"
          7. **Origin** (if determined): Geographic origin
          8. **Comments**: Additional relevant information
          9. **Photographs**: Scaled image of the item
          10. **Limitations**: Scope of examination stated

      - title: Report Language
        content: |
          Use precise, standardised terminology:

          - **CIBJO Blue Books**: International nomenclature standards
          - **ISO standards**: Where applicable
          - **Avoid subjective terms**: "Beautiful" is not scientific
          - **Qualify opinions**: "Consistent with...", "Evidence suggests..."
          - **State uncertainty**: If results are inconclusive, say so

      - title: Description vs Opinion
        content: |
          Distinguish clearly between:

          - **Observations**: Objective measurements and features
          - **Interpretations**: What observations mean
          - **Opinions**: Professional judgements

          Example:
          - Observation: "RI 1.544-1.553, uniaxial positive"
          - Interpretation: "Consistent with natural quartz"
          - Opinion: "Stone identified as natural amethyst"

  - title: Standard Terminology (CIBJO)
    content: |
      CIBJO (Confédération Internationale de la Bijouterie, Joaillerie, Orfèvrerie des
      Diamants, Perles et Pierres) sets international nomenclature standards.

  - title: Disclosure Requirements
    content: |
      Disclosure of treatments, synthetics, and simulants is both an ethical obligation
      and often a legal requirement.
    subsections:
      - title: What Must Be Disclosed
        content: |
          **Always disclose:**
          - Synthetic or laboratory-grown status
          - All treatments that affect durability (filling, coating)
          - All treatments that affect appearance (heating, diffusion)
          - Composite or assembled nature

          **Disclosure timing:**
          - Before sale is completed
          - In writing for significant transactions
          - On any laboratory report

      - title: How to Disclose
        content: |
          Disclosure should be:

          - **Clear**: Use plain language the buyer understands
          - **Prominent**: Not hidden in fine print
          - **Documented**: Written record for significant sales
          - **Complete**: Include all relevant treatments
          - **Accurate**: Based on testing, not assumptions

      - title: Non-Disclosure Consequences
        content: |
          Failure to disclose can result in:

          - Consumer protection violations
          - Trade descriptions act breaches
          - Professional sanctions
          - Civil liability (rescission, damages)
          - Criminal prosecution in serious cases
          - Reputation damage

      title: Legal Requirement
      text: |
        In most jurisdictions, non-disclosure of material treatments or synthetic status
        constitutes fraud or misrepresentation. "The seller didn't ask" is not a defence.
        Professional gemmologists have a duty to disclose even when not specifically asked.

  - title: Legal Aspects
    content: |
      Gemmologists may face legal responsibilities in various contexts including sales,
      valuations, expert testimony, and professional liability.
    subsections:
      - title: Trade Descriptions Legislation
        content: |
          Most countries have laws prohibiting false or misleading descriptions:

          - **UK**: Consumer Rights Act 2015, Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading
          - **EU**: Unfair Commercial Practices Directive
          - **US**: FTC Guides for Jewelry Industry
          - **Australia**: Australian Consumer Law

          False descriptions of gem identity, origin, or treatment status violate these laws.

      - title: Liability Considerations
        content: |
          **Professional liability** can arise from:
          - Misidentification of stones
          - Failure to detect treatments
          - Incorrect valuations
          - Negligent advice

          **Protection measures:**
          - Professional indemnity insurance
          - Clear limitation statements on reports
          - Documented testing procedures
          - Continuing professional development

      - title: Valuation Standards
        content: |
          Insurance and estate valuations carry legal weight:

          - Must reflect appropriate market value
          - Purpose of valuation affects methodology
          - Replacement value vs. fair market value
          - Must be defensible if challenged
          - May be used in legal proceedings

      - title: Expert Witness Responsibilities
        content: |
          Gemmologists serving as expert witnesses must:

          - Provide independent, unbiased opinions
          - Base opinions on established methodology
          - Stay within area of competence
          - Disclose limitations of analysis
