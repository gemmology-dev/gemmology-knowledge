  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Understanding gemstone durability is essential for recommending appropriate settings,
      cleaning methods, and care instructions. Durability encompasses three factors:
      hardness, toughness, and stability.

      A gem suitable for everyday ring wear must score well in all three areas. Many
      beautiful gems are better suited for occasional wear or protected settings.

  - title: The Three Durability Factors
    comparison:
      items:
        - title: Hardness
          points:
            - Resistance to scratching
            - Measured on Mohs scale (1-10)
            - Important for wear resistance
            - Gems below 7 scratch easily
            - Dust contains quartz (H 7)
        - title: Toughness
          points:
            - Resistance to breaking/chipping
            - Related to crystal structure
            - Cleavage reduces toughness
            - Jade is tougher than diamond
            - Important for impact resistance
        - title: Stability
          points:
            - Resistance to chemicals/light/heat
            - Fading from light exposure
            - Damage from heat or acids
            - Some gems are temperature sensitive
            - Important for long-term care

  - title: Hardness Considerations
    content: |
      The Mohs scale is ordinal, not linear—the jump from 9 to 10 is enormous. Household
      dust contains quartz particles (H 7), so gems below 7 will gradually accumulate
      scratches during normal wear.

      headers:
        - Category
        - Hardness
        - Suitability
        - Examples
      rows:
        - ["Excellent", "8-10", "Daily ring wear", "Diamond, ruby, sapphire, chrysoberyl"]
        - ["Good", "7-7.5", "Everyday with care", "Quartz, tourmaline, garnet, beryl"]

        - ["Fragile", "<5", "Display or very protected wear", "Pearl, coral, amber, fluorite"]

  - title: Toughness and Cleavage
    content: |
      Cleavage—the tendency to break along crystallographic planes—significantly affects
      toughness. Even hard gems can be brittle.
    subsections:
      - title: High-Risk Cleavage Gems
        table:
          headers:
            - Gem

            - ["Topaz", "Perfect basal {001}", "Very prone to chipping"]
            - ["Kunzite", "Perfect prismatic", "Extremely fragile for setting"]
            - ["Fluorite", "Perfect octahedral {111}", "Very brittle"]
            - ["Tanzanite", "Perfect {010}", "Easily damaged in setting"]
            - ["Feldspar (moonstone)", "Perfect two directions", "Prone to chipping"]

      - title: Tough Gems
        content: |
          Some gems have exceptional toughness despite moderate hardness:

          - **Nephrite jade** (H 6-6.5): Interlocking fibrous structure
          - **Jadeite** (H 6.5-7): Granular interlocking structure
          - **Chalcedony** (H 7): Microcrystalline aggregate

          These gems resist chipping better than single-crystal gems of higher hardness.

  - title: Stability Factors
    content: |
      Many gems are sensitive to environmental conditions that can cause fading,
      colour change, or physical damage.

  - title: Cleaning Methods
    content: |
      Different gems require different cleaning approaches. Using the wrong method can
      cause permanent damage.
    subsections:
      - title: Safe Cleaning Methods
        table:
          headers:
            - Method

            - ["Dry brush", "Soft brush, no liquid", "Porous gems", "N/A (gentle method)"]

      - title: Ultrasonic Cleaning Safety
        content: |
          Ultrasonic cleaners use vibration to remove dirt but can cause damage to:

          - **Filled gems**: Can remove or damage fillers (emerald, ruby)
          - **Gems with cleavage**: Vibration can propagate fractures
          - **Fragile inclusions**: Can cause expansion/damage
          - **Organic gems**: Can damage pearl nacre, amber
          - **Treated gems**: May affect surface treatments

      - title: Steam Cleaning Safety
        content: |
          Steam cleaning combines heat and moisture, dangerous for:

          - **Oiled emeralds**: Heat can remove oil
          - **Heat-sensitive gems**: Thermal shock risk
          - **Filled gems**: Heat damages many fillers
          - **Opal**: Rapid temperature change causes crazing

  - title: Setting Recommendations
    content: |
      The choice of setting can protect vulnerable gems or expose durable gems to show
      their beauty.
    subsections:

        table:
          headers:
            - Setting Type

            - ["Tension", "Low", "Very hard, tough gems only"]
            - ["Bar", "Low to moderate", "Harder gems preferred"]

      - title: Setting by Gem Type
        content: |
          **Recommended for prong settings (rings):**
          Diamond, ruby, sapphire, chrysoberyl, spinel

          **Recommend bezel or protective settings:**
          Emerald, tanzanite, opal, moonstone, tourmaline, peridot

          **Best avoided in rings:**
          Kunzite, fluorite, apatite, pearl (unless protective setting)

  - title: Storage Guidelines
    subsections:
      - title: Separation
        content: |
          Store gems separately to prevent harder gems from scratching softer ones:

          - Individual pouches or compartments
          - Soft fabric lining
          - Never loose in a box together
          - Diamond will scratch everything else

      - title: Environment
        content: |
          - **Humidity**: Some gems need moisture (opal, pearl); others need dry (iron pyrite)
          - **Light**: Store light-sensitive gems in dark containers
          - **Temperature**: Avoid extreme temperatures; room temperature ideal
          - **Air**: Some gems need ventilation; airtight can trap moisture

  - title: Special Care Gems
    subsections:
      - title: Opal
        content: |
          Opal contains 3-21% water and is prone to "crazing" (network of fine cracks):

          - Avoid rapid temperature changes
          - Store with damp cotton (not wet)
          - Never use ultrasonic or steam
          - Keep away from direct sunlight and heat
          - Doublets and triplets are especially vulnerable to water

      - title: Pearl
        content: |
          Pearls are sensitive to acids, cosmetics, and drying:

          - Apply perfume and hairspray before putting on pearls
          - Wipe with soft cloth after wearing
          - Store in breathable fabric, not plastic
          - Restring regularly (silk stretches and weakens)
          - Occasional wearing maintains moisture balance

      - title: Emerald
        content: |
          Nearly all emeralds are oiled to improve apparent clarity:

          - Oil can dry out or exude over time
          - Avoid ultrasonic and steam cleaning
          - Avoid heat (jeweller's torch is dangerous)
          - May need periodic re-oiling
          - Store away from heat sources

      - title: Tanzanite
        content: |
          Tanzanite has perfect cleavage and is heat-sensitive:

          - Extremely vulnerable during setting (cleavage)
          - Never use ultrasonic or steam
          - Avoid sudden temperature changes
          - Not recommended for daily ring wear
          - Excellent for earrings and pendants

  - title: Care Summary
    callout:
      type: tip
      title: Universal Care Rules
      text: |
        1. **Remove rings** during physical work, gardening, sports
        2. **Put jewellery on last** after cosmetics, perfume, hairspray
        3. **Remove jewellery first** before showering, swimming, sleeping
        4. **Clean gently** with appropriate methods for each gem
        5. **Store separately** in soft, individual compartments
        6. **Inspect regularly** for loose settings, worn prongs
        7. **Know your gem** and its specific vulnerabilities
