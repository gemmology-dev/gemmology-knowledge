  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Geographic origin determination identifies the locality where a gemstone formed.
      Origin can significantly affect value, with certain sources commanding substantial
      premiums due to historical significance, quality associations, or rarity.

      Origin is determined through careful analysis of inclusion suites, trace element
      chemistry, and growth characteristics. Major gemmological laboratories (GIA,
      Gübelin, SSEF, AGL) issue origin reports for high-value coloured stones.

  - title: Origin Determination Methods
    subsections:
      - title: Inclusion Analysis
        content: |
          The primary method for origin determination. Characteristic inclusions form
          fingerprints unique to specific geological environments:

          - **Mineral inclusions**: Identify host rock and formation conditions
          - **Fluid inclusions**: Reveal formation fluids and temperatures
          - **Growth patterns**: Record crystallization history
          - **Solid inclusion assemblages**: Diagnostic for specific localities

      - title: Trace Element Chemistry
        content: |
          Advanced spectroscopic techniques measure trace elements that vary by deposit:

          - **LA-ICP-MS**: Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
          - **LIBS**: Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy
          - **ED-XRF**: Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence

          Ratios of elements like Fe, Ti, Ga, V, and Cr help distinguish origins.

      - title: Spectroscopic Features
        content: |
          - UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra
          - Photoluminescence characteristics
          - Infrared spectroscopy
          - Raman spectroscopy for inclusion identification

  - title: Kashmir Sapphire
    content: |
      Kashmir sapphires are the most prized blue sapphires, known for their unique
      "velvety" or "sleepy" appearance. The deposit was discovered in 1881 and largely
      exhausted by the early 1900s.
    subsections:
      - title: Characteristic Appearance
        content: |
          - **Velvety lustre**: Soft, sleepy appearance from micro-inclusions
          - **Cornflower blue**: Medium-toned, slightly violet-blue
          - **Zoning**: Often shows colour zoning, lighter and darker areas
          - **Haze**: Fine particulate inclusions scatter light internally

      - title: Diagnostic Inclusions
        table:
          headers:
            - Inclusion
            - Description

      title: Kashmir Premium
      text: |
        A fine Kashmir sapphire can sell for $100,000–200,000+ per carat at auction.
        The combination of historical prestige, unique appearance, and extreme rarity
        makes Kashmir origin the most valuable designation for blue sapphire.

  - title: Burmese Ruby (Mogok)
    content: |
      Mogok, Myanmar (formerly Burma) produces the world's finest rubies. The term
      "pigeon blood" originated here to describe the ideal red colour.
    subsections:
      - title: Characteristic Appearance
        content: |
          - **Pigeon blood red**: Vivid, slightly bluish-red with medium-dark tone
          - **Strong fluorescence**: Glows in daylight due to low iron content
          - **Silk**: Short rutile needles create soft appearance when present
          - **Transparency**: High-clarity stones possible

      - title: Diagnostic Inclusions
        table:
          headers:
            - Inclusion

            - ["Negative crystals", "Angular voids with fluid"]

      - title: Pigeon Blood Terminology
        content: |
          "Pigeon blood" describes the ideal ruby colour: vivid red with a slight blue
          modifier, medium-dark tone, and strong saturation. The term is subjective and
          used loosely in trade; major labs have their own criteria for applying it.

          Only Burmese rubies historically received this designation, though exceptional
          rubies from other origins may now qualify at some laboratories.

  - title: Thai and Cambodian Ruby

      title: Colombian Emerald Signature
      text: |
        The three-phase inclusion (liquid + gas bubble + halite crystal) is virtually
        diagnostic for Colombian origin. The halite cube can sometimes be observed to
        dissolve when heated and recrystallize on cooling.

  - title: Zambian Emerald
    content: |

      title: Premium Variability
      text: |
        Origin premiums are highly variable and depend on:

        - Stone quality (colour, clarity, size)
        - Treatment status (unheated commands more premium)
        - Market conditions and demand
        - Individual stone characteristics

        A fine Ceylon sapphire will always be worth more than a poor Kashmir sapphire.
        Origin alone does not guarantee value.

  - title: Laboratory Origin Reports
