  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Amber is fossilised tree resin, typically 20-100+ million years old. Valued
      for its warm golden colour, transparency, and remarkable preservation of
      ancient life forms, amber provides a window into prehistoric ecosystems.

      Unlike most gems, amber is entirely organic, formed from the resin of
      ancient coniferous trees.

      How amber forms:
    subsections:
      - title: Formation Process
        content: |
          1. Tree exudes sticky resin (response to injury)
          2. Resin may trap insects, plant material, debris
          3. Resin is buried by sediment
          4. Over millions of years, polymerisation occurs
          5. Volatile compounds evaporate; resin hardens
          6. Becomes amber after ~2-10 million years

      - title: Composition
        content: |
          - **Organic polymers**: No fixed chemical formula
          - **Main components**: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
          - **Variable**: Composition differs by source tree
          - **Succinic acid**: Baltic amber contains 3-8%

        - Characteristics
      rows:
        - ["Baltic (Europe)", "40-50 million years", "Yellow to cognac; succinite; most common"]
        - ["Dominican Republic", "20-30 million years", "Blue fluorescence; rare blue amber"]

  - title: Colour Varieties
    content: |
      Amber occurs in many colours:
    subsections:
      - title: Common Colours
        content: |
          - **Honey/cognac**: Most common; warm golden brown
          - **Yellow**: Light to golden yellow
          - **Cherry**: Reddish-brown; treated or natural
          - **Green**: Rare; natural or treated
          - **White (bone)**: Opaque; from micro-bubbles

      - title: Blue Amber
        content: |
          Dominican blue amber is exceptionally rare:

          - Appears normal in transmitted light
          - Shows blue fluorescence in UV/sunlight
          - Caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
          - Commands significant premiums

  - title: Inclusions
    content: |
      Amber famously preserves ancient life:
    subsections:
      - title: Biological Inclusions
        content: |
          - **Insects**: Flies, ants, beetles, wasps, spiders
          - **Plant material**: Leaves, flowers, seeds, pollen
          - **Hair/feathers**: Rare; scientifically important
          - **Air bubbles**: Common; create cloudiness

      - title: Value of Inclusions
        content: |
          Inclusions can dramatically increase value:

          - Rare or unusual specimens: Exceptional prices
          - Well-preserved, visible insects: Premium
          - Multiple inclusions in one piece: Valuable
          - Scientific importance: Museum interest

          Common inclusions (gnats, air bubbles) add less value.

  - title: Amber vs Copal
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Important Distinction
      text: |
        Copal is younger, semi-fossilised resin (typically <1 million years):

        - Softer than true amber
        - Dissolves more readily in solvents
        - Often sold as "young amber" (misrepresentation)
        - Much lower value than true amber

        Test: Acetone softens copal surface but not true amber.

  - title: Treatments
    content: |
      Common amber treatments:
    subsections:
      - title: Clarification
        content: |
          - Heat/pressure treatment to clear cloudy amber
          - Creates "sun spangles" (disc-shaped stress marks)
          - Very common; accepted practice
          - Often not disclosed

      - title: Other Treatments
        content: |
          - **Dyeing**: Changes colour (especially green, cherry)
          - **Heated/pressed**: Reconstituded from small pieces
          - **Coated**: Surface enhancement
          - **Filled**: Repairs or creates fake inclusions

  - title: Fake Inclusions Warning
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Forged Inclusions
      text: |
        Fake inclusions exist:

        - Modern insects placed in resin or copal
        - "Amber" with too-perfect or unusual inclusions
        - Large insects (rare in genuine amber)
        - Scorpions, lizards (extremely rare naturally)

        Always examine inclusions carefully. Position, condition, and
        associated debris should look natural. Get significant pieces certified.

  - title: Care and Durability
    content: |
      Amber requires gentle handling:

      - **Hardness**: 2-2.5 (very easily scratched)
      - **Solvents**: Avoid alcohol, perfume, hairspray
      - **Heat**: Can crack or cloud
      - **Sunlight**: May darken over time
      - **Cleaning**: Warm water, soft cloth only
      - **Storage**: Keep away from harder gems
