  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Diamond is the hardest natural material and one of the most valued gemstones.
      Its unique combination of hardness, brilliance, and dispersion makes it ideal
      for jewellery, while its structure and formation provide fascinating scientific
      study.

      Understanding diamond requires knowledge of its type classification (based on
      nitrogen content), the 4Cs grading system, fancy colour assessment, and methods
      to distinguish natural from laboratory-grown stones.

  - title: Diamond Type Classification
    content: |
      Diamonds are classified into types based on nitrogen content and its arrangement
      in the crystal lattice. Type affects colour, physical properties, and response
      to treatments.
    subsections:
      - title: Type System Overview
        table:
          headers:
            - Type
            - Nitrogen Content
            - Characteristics
            - Frequency
          rows:
            - ["Type Ia", "Aggregated nitrogen (A and B centres)", "Cape series yellow tint; most common", "~98% of natural"]
            - ["Type IaA", "Paired nitrogen (A centres)", "Near-colourless to light yellow", "Common"]
            - ["Type IaB", "Clustered nitrogen (B centres)", "Less yellow; may show H3/H4 centres", "Less common"]
            - ["Type Ib", "Isolated nitrogen", "Intense yellow or brown", "~0.1% natural; common synthetic"]
            - ["Type IIa", "No nitrogen", "Colourless or brown; often finest quality", "~1-2% natural"]
            - ["Type IIb", "Boron (no nitrogen)", "Blue; electrically conductive", "Very rare"]

      - title: Type Significance
        content: |
          Understanding diamond type is important because:

          - **Treatment response**: Type IIa brown diamonds can be HPHT-treated to colourless
          - **Colour origin**: Type determines cause of colour
          - **Value**: Type IIa diamonds are often exceptional
          - **Synthetic identification**: Type Ib common in HPHT synthetics
          - **Scientific interest**: Type reveals formation conditions

      - title: Testing for Type
        content: |
          Diamond type is determined by:

          - **Infrared spectroscopy**: Nitrogen absorption patterns
          - **UV-Vis absorption**: Colour centres
          - **Photoluminescence**: Characteristic emissions

          Standard gemmological tools cannot determine type; laboratory analysis is required.

  - title: The 4Cs for Diamond
    content: |
      The GIA 4Cs system (Colour, Clarity, Cut, Carat weight) is the universal standard
      for diamond grading. Understanding this system is essential for any gemmologist.

  - title: Colour Grading
    subsections:
      - title: D-Z Colour Scale
        content: |
          The GIA colour scale grades diamonds from D (colourless) to Z (light yellow/brown):

          - **D, E, F**: Colourless (most valuable)
          - **G, H, I, J**: Near-colourless
          - **K, L, M**: Faint yellow
          - **N, O, P, Q, R**: Very light yellow
          - **S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**: Light yellow

          Beyond Z, stones enter the "fancy colour" category where yellow is desirable.

      - title: Colour Grading Conditions
        content: |
          Accurate colour grading requires:

          - **Master stones**: Comparison set of known grades
          - **Standard lighting**: D65 daylight equivalent
          - **Neutral background**: White or grey grading tray
          - **Controlled viewing**: Table-down, pavilion up
          - **Multiple observations**: Check from different angles

      - title: Colour Price Impact
        table:
          headers:
            - Colour Range
            - Price Impact
            - Notes
          rows:
            - ["D-F", "Premium", "Colourless; highest value"]
            - ["G-H", "Good value", "Face-up appear colourless"]
            - ["I-J", "Budget friendly", "Slight warmth; good value"]
            - ["K+", "Discounted", "Visible tint; value option"]

  - title: Clarity Grading
    subsections:
      - title: GIA Clarity Scale
        table:
          headers:
            - Grade
            - Name
            - Description
          rows:
            - ["FL", "Flawless", "No inclusions/blemishes at 10×"]
            - ["IF", "Internally Flawless", "No inclusions; minor blemishes at 10×"]
            - ["VVS1, VVS2", "Very Very Slightly Included", "Minute inclusions; very difficult to see at 10×"]
            - ["VS1, VS2", "Very Slightly Included", "Minor inclusions; difficult to see at 10×"]
            - ["SI1, SI2", "Slightly Included", "Noticeable inclusions at 10×; may be eye-visible"]
            - ["I1, I2, I3", "Included", "Obvious inclusions; may affect durability/beauty"]

      - title: Clarity Factors
        content: |
          Five factors determine clarity grade:

          1. **Size**: Larger inclusions have more impact
          2. **Number**: Multiple inclusions reduce grade
          3. **Position**: Central inclusions more visible
          4. **Nature**: Type of inclusion (feather vs crystal)
          5. **Relief**: Contrast with surrounding diamond

      - title: Eye-Clean Concept
        content: |
          Many buyers seek "eye-clean" diamonds:

          - No inclusions visible to unaided eye
          - Typically SI1 and above
          - Depends on stone size (larger = more visible)
          - Personal perception varies

  - title: Cut Grading
    subsections:
      - title: GIA Cut Grade (Round Brilliant)
        content: |
          GIA grades round brilliant cut on five levels:

          - **Excellent**: Maximum brilliance and fire
          - **Very Good**: High performance
          - **Good**: Standard appearance
          - **Fair**: Below standard
          - **Poor**: Significant performance issues

      - title: Cut Quality Factors
        table:
          headers:
            - Factor
            - Excellent Range
            - Effect
          rows:
            - ["Table %", "54-57%", "Balance of brilliance and fire"]
            - ["Depth %", "59-62.3%", "Light return and face-up size"]
            - ["Crown angle", "34-35°", "Fire and brilliance balance"]
            - ["Pavilion angle", "40.6-41°", "Critical for light return"]
            - ["Girdle", "Thin to slightly thick", "Durability and face-up size"]

      - title: Light Performance
        content: |
          Well-cut diamonds maximise:

          - **Brilliance**: White light return
          - **Fire**: Spectral dispersion
          - **Scintillation**: Sparkle pattern when moved

          Poor cuts show:
          - **Windowing**: Light passes through
          - **Extinction**: Dark areas
          - **Fish-eye**: Girdle reflection visible

  - title: Carat Weight
    content: |
      Carat is the metric unit for gemstone weight: 1 carat = 0.200 grams = 200 milligrams.
    subsections:
      - title: Weight-Size Relationship
        content: |
          Standard round brilliant approximate dimensions by weight:

          - 0.25 ct: ~4.1mm diameter
          - 0.50 ct: ~5.1mm diameter
          - 1.00 ct: ~6.5mm diameter
          - 2.00 ct: ~8.2mm diameter

          Actual dimensions vary based on cut proportions.

      - title: Price Per Carat Jumps
        content: |
          Price per carat increases at threshold weights:

          - 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.70, 0.90 ct: Minor jumps
          - 1.00 ct: Major threshold (20-40% jump)
          - 1.50, 2.00, 3.00 ct: Significant premiums
          - 5.00+ ct: Exceptional premiums

          A 0.99 ct diamond costs significantly less per carat than a 1.01 ct stone.

  - title: Fancy Colour Diamonds
    content: |
      Diamonds with colour beyond Z, or with colours other than yellow/brown, are graded
      as fancy colours with different criteria.

            - ["Black", "Graphite inclusions", "Relatively common"]
            - ["White", "Milky inclusions", "Uncommon"]

      - title: Value Hierarchy
        content: |
          Fancy colour value (generally, for equivalent saturation):

          1. **Red**: Rarest and most valuable
          2. **Blue**: Very rare; high value
          3. **Pink**: Extremely desirable
          4. **Green**: Rare; valuable
          5. **Orange**: Relatively rare
          6. **Yellow**: Most common fancy; value varies
          7. **Brown**: Most abundant; lowest fancy value

  - title: Natural vs Lab-Grown Diamonds

      Distinguishing natural from laboratory-grown diamonds is increasingly important
      as lab-grown quality and availability increase.
