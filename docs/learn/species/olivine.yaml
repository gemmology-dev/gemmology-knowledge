  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Olivine ((Mg,Fe)₂SiO₄) is an iron-magnesium silicate, and its gem-quality
      variety is known as peridot. One of the few gems that occur in only one
      colour, peridot has been treasured since antiquity for its distinctive
      yellow-green to olive green colour.

      Peridot is the birthstone for August and has been found in meteorites,
      making it one of the few extraterrestrial gems.

      - title: Crystal System and Structure
        content: |
          - **Crystal system**: Orthorhombic
          - **Chemical formula**: (Mg,Fe)₂SiO₄
          - **Series**: Forsterite (Mg) to Fayalite (Fe)
          - **Gem composition**: Usually ~88-92% forsterite
          - **Cleavage**: Poor (rarely seen)

          headers:
            - Property
            - Value
          rows:
            - ["Hardness", "6.5-7 Mohs"]
            - ["Specific gravity", "3.27-3.37"]
            - ["Refractive index", "1.654-1.690"]
            - ["Birefringence", "0.035-0.038 (high)"]
            - ["Optic character", "Biaxial positive"]
            - ["Pleochroism", "Weak (yellowish-green to green)"]
            - ["Lustre", "Vitreous to oily"]

  - title: Colour
    content: |
      Peridot occurs in a single hue family:

      - **Chromophore**: Iron (Fe²⁺)
      - **Colour range**: Yellow-green to olive green to brownish-green
      - **Ideal**: Vivid lime green without brown
      - **No treatment**: Peridot is never heat-treated for colour

      The finest colour is a vivid lime green without yellow or brown modifiers.
      Iron content determines the depth of colour.

      title: Diagnostic Inclusion
      text: |
        Peridot is famous for "lily pad" inclusions—disc-shaped stress fractures
        surrounding tiny chromite crystals. These appear as small round
        "explosions" when viewed under magnification.

        Lily pads are virtually diagnostic for peridot and help separate it
        from similar green gems.

    table:
      headers:
        - Origin
        - Characteristics
      rows:
        - ["Myanmar (Mogok)", "Finest colour; limited availability"]
        - ["Pakistan (Kashmir)", "Large, fine crystals"]
        - ["China (Changbai)", "Major current producer"]
        - ["Arizona (San Carlos)", "Smaller stones; Native American jewellery"]
        - ["Zabargad (Egypt)", "Historic source; now exhausted"]
        - ["Vietnam", "Good quality material"]
        - ["Ethiopia", "Emerging source"]

      title: Historic Source
      text: |
        The island of Zabargad (St. John's Island) in the Red Sea was the
        primary peridot source for over 3,500 years. Ancient Egyptians called
        it "the gem of the sun." The mines are now exhausted.

        Interestingly, "Topazios," the Greek name for this island, is where
        the word "topaz" originated—though the island produced peridot, not topaz.

  - title: Characteristic Inclusions
    content: |
      Peridot shows distinctive internal features:

      - **Lily pads**: Stress discs around chromite crystals (diagnostic)
      - **Chromite crystals**: Small black octahedra
      - **Needle inclusions**: Fine, oriented needles
      - **Negative crystals**: Angular voids
      - **Healing feathers**: Plane fractures with fluid

  - title: High Birefringence Effect
    content: |
      Peridot's high birefringence (0.035-0.038) causes visible doubling:

      - Back facet edges appear doubled
      - More obvious in larger stones
      - Viewing direction affects visibility
      - Helps distinguish from similar gems (demantoid is SR)

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for peridot identification:

      - **RI**: 1.654-1.690 (distinctive range)
      - **SG**: 3.34 (characteristic)
      - **Birefringence**: 0.035-0.038 (high; visible doubling)
      - **Colour**: Yellow-green to olive green only
      - **Spectrum**: Three Fe bands at 493, 473, 453nm
      - **Inclusions**: Lily pads diagnostic

  - title: Distinguishing Similar Gems
    table:
      headers:
        - Gem
        - Key Distinction from Peridot
      rows:
        - ["Demantoid garnet", "Garnet is SR (no doubling); higher RI"]
        - ["Green tourmaline", "Different RI range; different spectrum"]
        - ["Chrome diopside", "Lower birefringence; different RI"]
        - ["Green zircon", "Higher RI (1.93+); higher SG"]
        - ["Moldavite", "Much lower RI (1.48); glass"]

  - title: Care and Durability
    content: |
      Peridot requires some care in jewellery:

      - Hardness 6.5-7 means it can scratch
      - Sensitive to acids (even weak ones)
      - Avoid ultrasonic and steam cleaning
      - Warm soapy water is safe
      - Best for earrings, pendants, occasional ring wear
      - Protect from hard impacts
