  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Beryl (Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈) is a beryllium aluminium silicate that produces several
      important gem varieties. Emerald and aquamarine are the most significant, but
      morganite, heliodor, and red beryl also have strong market positions.

      Despite sharing the same basic chemistry and structure, beryl varieties differ
      dramatically in value based on colour, clarity, and origin.

      - title: Crystal System and Structure
        content: |
          - **Crystal system**: Hexagonal
          - **Chemical formula**: Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈
          - **Habit**: Hexagonal prisms, often elongated
          - **Cleavage**: Imperfect basal (rarely seen)
          - **Fracture**: Conchoidal to uneven

  - title: Emerald
    content: |
      Emerald is the green variety of beryl, coloured by chromium and/or vanadium.
      It is one of the "big three" coloured stones alongside ruby and sapphire.
    subsections:
      - title: Colour and Chromophores
        content: |
          - **Primary chromophore**: Chromium (Cr³⁺)
          - **Secondary**: Vanadium (V³⁺) in some sources
          - **Iron influence**: Can modify towards bluish-green
          - **Ideal colour**: Vivid, medium-dark green without excessive blue

          Some authorities require chromium for true emerald designation, while
          others accept vanadium-coloured green beryl as emerald.

            - Characteristics
            - Market Position
          rows:
            - ["Colombia (Muzo)", "Pure green, three-phase inclusions", "Highest premiums"]
            - ["Colombia (Chivor)", "Slightly bluish, often cleaner", "High value"]
            - ["Zambia", "Bluish-green, better clarity", "Second largest producer"]
            - ["Brazil", "Variable quality, often lighter", "Significant volume"]
            - ["Ethiopia", "Good colour, often more transparent", "Emerging source"]
            - ["Afghanistan", "Fine colour, historical source", "Limited production"]

      - title: The Jardín
        content: |
          Emeralds are expected to have inclusions—the French word "jardín" (garden)
          describes the typical internal landscape:

          - Inclusions are more accepted than in other gems
          - "Eye-clean" emeralds command significant premiums
          - Heavy inclusions can affect durability
          - Inclusions help confirm natural origin

      title: Three-Phase Inclusions
      text: |
        The three-phase inclusion (liquid + gas bubble + halite cube) is virtually
        diagnostic for Colombian origin. The halite crystal can sometimes be seen
        to dissolve when heated and recrystallize on cooling.

        Additional Colombian indicators: calcite rhombs, pyrite crystals, jagged
        growth tubes, and characteristic fingerprint patterns.

  - title: Aquamarine
    content: |
      Aquamarine is the blue to blue-green variety of beryl, coloured by iron.
      It is the most widely available beryl variety.
    subsections:
      - title: Colour Characteristics
        content: |
          - **Chromophore**: Iron (Fe²⁺)
          - **Colour range**: Light blue to blue-green to greenish-blue
          - **Most valued**: Medium-dark saturated blue (Santa Maria type)
          - **Pleochroism**: Weak (colourless to pale blue)

          Most aquamarines are heat-treated to reduce green and enhance blue.

  - title: Red Beryl Rarity
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Extremely Rare
      text: |
        Red beryl is one of the world's rarest gemstones, found in commercial
        quantities only in the Wah Wah Mountains of Utah. Clean stones over
        1 carat are exceptionally rare, and fine specimens can exceed ruby
        prices per carat.

        Note: Synthetic red beryl exists and should be distinguished.

  - title: Treatments
    content: |
      Beryl undergoes several treatments:
    subsections:
      - title: Oiling (Emerald)
        content: |
          The most common emerald treatment:

          - Oil fills surface-reaching fractures
          - Improves apparent clarity
          - Cedar oil traditional; polymers also used
          - Minor oiling widely accepted
          - Significant oiling reduces value
          - Requires disclosure

      - title: Heat Treatment
        content: |
          - **Aquamarine**: Removes green, enhances blue (routine)
          - **Morganite**: Removes yellow, enhances pink (common)
          - **Stable**: Heat-treated colours permanent
          - **Accepted**: Routine practice; disclosure standard

      - title: Fracture Filling (Emerald)
        content: |
          Beyond oiling, resins and polymers used:

          - Opticon, Gematrat, ExCel (brand names)
          - More stable than oil in some cases
          - Can show UV fluorescence
          - Must be disclosed; affects value

  - title: Historical Significance
    content: |
      Beryl has been treasured throughout history:

      - **Cleopatra's Mines**: Egyptian emerald mines (Sikait, Zabara)
      - **Spanish Conquest**: Colombian emeralds reached Europe 16th century
      - **Moghul Emeralds**: Carved Indian emeralds of exceptional size
      - **Dom Pedro Aquamarine**: 10,363 ct obelisk in Smithsonian
