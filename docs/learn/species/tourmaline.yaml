  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Tourmaline is a boron silicate mineral group occurring in more colours than any other
      gemstone. Its complex chemistry allows for virtually every colour in the spectrum,
      from colourless to black, often in the same crystal.

      The name comes from the Sinhalese "turmali," meaning mixed coloured stones.

      - title: Chemistry and Structure
        content: |
          Tourmaline has a complex formula with multiple substitution sites:

          **General formula**: XY₃Z₆(BO₃)₃Si₆O₁₈(OH)₄

          Where X, Y, and Z represent different sites accommodating various elements.
          This flexibility produces the remarkable colour range.

  - title: Paraíba Tourmaline
    content: |
      Copper-bearing tourmaline with unique neon colours, among the world's most
      valuable coloured stones.
    subsections:
      - title: Discovery and History
        content: |
          - **Discovered**: 1989 in Paraíba state, Brazil
          - **Discoverer**: Heitor Dimas Barbosa
          - **Impact**: Created new price category for tourmaline
          - **Similar material**: Found in Nigeria (2001), Mozambique (2005)

      - title: Characteristics
        content: |
          - **Colour cause**: Copper (Cu²⁺), often with manganese
          - **Unique colours**: Electric blue, neon green, violet
          - **"Glow" effect**: Appears luminescent from within
          - **Typical sizes**: Brazilian material usually under 3 carats

            - Market Position
          rows:
            - ["Brazil (Paraíba)", "Most saturated neon blue", "Highest prices"]
            - ["Brazil (Rio Grande do Norte)", "Similar to Paraíba", "High value"]
            - ["Nigeria", "Good colour; larger sizes", "Lower than Brazilian"]
            - ["Mozambique", "Often lighter; large sizes possible", "Lower premium"]

      - title: Identification
        content: |
          - Must contain copper (Cu)—verified by chemical analysis
          - Geographic origin requires trace element ratios (Cu/Mn, Ga, Pb)
          - Inclusions less diagnostic than for other gems
          - Lab certification essential for high-value stones

  - title: Paraíba Prices
    callout:
      type: info
      title: Exceptional Value
      text: |
        Fine Brazilian Paraíba tourmaline can exceed $50,000 per carat, rivaling
        the finest sapphires. The unique neon colour, extreme rarity (original
        deposit essentially depleted), and strong collector demand maintain
        exceptional prices.

        Mozambican and Nigerian material, while beautiful, trades at a fraction
        of Brazilian prices.

  - title: Chrome Tourmaline
    content: |
      Intense green tourmaline coloured by chromium:

      - **Chromophore**: Chromium (Cr³⁺)
      - **Colour**: Intense, vivid green
      - **Spectrum**: Shows Cr doublet in red
      - **Sources**: Tanzania, Kenya (East Africa)
      - **Distinction**: Richer green than iron-coloured verdelite
      - **Value**: Higher than common green tourmaline

  - title: Multicoloured Tourmaline

      Tourmaline frequently shows colour zoning:
    subsections:
      - title: Bi-colour and Tri-colour
        content: |
          - Colour changes along crystal length
          - Common combinations: pink-green, blue-green
          - Cut to display multiple colours
          - Premium for attractive combinations

      - title: Watermelon Tourmaline
        content: |
          - Pink/red core with green outer zone
          - Named for resemblance to watermelon slice
          - Often cut as slices to show pattern
          - Brazilian material especially fine
          - Highly collectible with good patterns

  - title: Pleochroism Considerations
    callout:
      type: tip
      title: Strong Pleochroism Affects Cutting
      text: |
        Tourmaline's strong pleochroism (often dark to light of the same hue)
        significantly affects cutting:

        - **Dark stones**: Cut with table perpendicular to c-axis (lighter)
        - **Light stones**: Cut with table parallel to c-axis (more saturated)
        - **Dichroscope**: Shows dramatic colour difference
        - **Value impact**: Poor orientation creates dark or light face-up colour

  - title: Characteristic Inclusions
    content: |
      Tourmaline shows distinctive internal features:

      - **Growth tubes**: Parallel to c-axis, often hollow or filled
      - **Thread-like inclusions**: Fine parallel channels
      - **Colour zoning**: Angular, following growth
      - **Liquid feathers**: Healed fracture patterns
      - **Crystal inclusions**: Various minerals depending on source

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for tourmaline identification:

      - **RI**: 1.620-1.640 (useful range)
      - **Birefringence**: 0.018-0.020 (moderately high)
      - **Strong pleochroism**: Dark/light of same hue
      - **SG**: 3.01-3.11
      - **Spectrum**: Variable by colour
      - **Paraíba**: Requires Cu detection for confirmation
