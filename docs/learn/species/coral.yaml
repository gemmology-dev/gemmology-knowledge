  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Precious coral is the calcified skeleton of colonial marine animals (genus
      Corallium). Prized for millennia, particularly in the Mediterranean cultures,
      fine red coral remains valuable despite conservation concerns.

      Unlike reef-building corals (which are not used in jewellery), precious
      coral grows in deep water and has a solid, polishable structure.

      Understanding precious coral:
    subsections:
      - title: What Is Coral?
        content: |
          - Colonial marine organisms (polyps)
          - Secrete calcium carbonate skeleton
          - Deep water (100-300+ metres)

      - title: Composition
        content: |
          - **Material**: Calcium carbonate (calcite form)
          - **Colour agents**: Carotenoid pigments
          - **Structure**: Concentric growth layers
          - **Grain**: Wood-like growth pattern visible when polished

      title: Conservation Status
      text: |
        Many coral species are protected under CITES (Convention on International
        Trade in Endangered Species):

        - Trade regulations vary by species and country
        - Documentation required for international trade
        - Some species banned from commercial harvest
        - Ethical alternatives available

        Always verify legality before purchase. Consider:
        - Vintage/antique coral (pre-ban)
        - Certified sustainable sources
        - Bamboo coral (different species, dyed)
        - Fossil coral (ancient, mineralised)

            - ["Pressed coral", "Reconstituted; grainy appearance"]

      - title: Ethical Alternatives
        content: |
          - **Bamboo coral**: Different species; often dyed
          - **Fossil coral**: Agatised ancient coral

          - **Sponge coral**: Different structure

  - title: Care and Durability
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Gentle Care Required
      text: |
        Coral is soft and sensitive:

        - **Hardness**: 3-4 (easily scratched)
        - **Acids**: Reacts with acids (including perspiration)
        - **Heat**: Can be damaged by heat
        - **Cleaning**: Warm water, soft cloth only
        - **Storage**: Separate from harder gems
        - **Wear**: Avoid contact with cosmetics, chemicals
