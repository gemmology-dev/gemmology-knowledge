  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Jet is fossilised wood (a form of lignite coal) that has been used as a gem
      material since prehistoric times. Most famous from Whitby, England, jet was
      extremely popular in Victorian mourning jewellery after Prince Albert's death.

      Unlike coal, which crumbles, jet is compact and takes an excellent polish,
      making it suitable for carving and jewellery.

      How jet forms:
    subsections:
      - title: Formation Process
        content: |
          1. Wood (often Araucaria trees) falls into water
          2. Becomes waterlogged and sinks into sediment
          3. Anaerobic conditions prevent complete decay
          4. Heat and pressure over millions of years
          5. Carbon-rich compact material forms

      - title: Composition
        content: |
          - **Origin**: Fossilised driftwood
          - **Type**: Compact lignite coal
          - **Age**: Jurassic period (~180 million years for Whitby)
          - **Carbon content**: High (similar to coal)

      title: Diagnostic Test
      text: |
        The hot needle test distinguishes jet from common simulants:

        - **Jet**: Produces a coal-like or bituminous smell
        - **Vulcanite**: Rubbery, sulphurous smell
        - **Bakelite**: Carbolic acid (chemical) smell
        - **Glass**: No smell (may show mark)
        - **Plastic**: Acrid, chemical smell

        Test in inconspicuous area; leaves small mark.

      Jet care considerations:
    subsections:
      - title: Advantages
        content: |
          - Warmer to touch than glass simulants
          - Lightweight for large pieces
          - Takes excellent polish
          - Relatively durable for organic gem

      - title: Care Guidelines
        content: |
          - Store separately from harder gems
          - Clean with damp cloth
          - Avoid harsh chemicals
          - Polish gently if needed
          - Avoid extreme heat or dryness
          - Can crack if dried out (especially soft jet)

  - title: Market Considerations
    content: |
      Jet market factors:

      - **Antique value**: Victorian pieces collectible
      - **Whitby premium**: Genuine Whitby commands higher prices
      - **Modern production**: Limited Whitby; Spanish jet available
      - **Simulants common**: Much "jet" is glass or plastic
      - **Provenance important**: Documentation adds value
