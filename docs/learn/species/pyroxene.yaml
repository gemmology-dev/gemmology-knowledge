  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      The pyroxene group is a family of chain silicates that includes several
      important gem materials. Jadeite is the most valuable—one of the two
      minerals called "jade." Spodumene produces kunzite and hiddenite, while
      chrome diopside offers affordable green colour.

  - title: Jadeite
    content: |
      Jadeite (NaAlSi₂O₆) is the more valuable of the two jade minerals,
      prized especially in Asian cultures.

      title: Exceptional Prices
      text: |
        Top-quality Imperial jade can command extraordinary prices—fine
        cabochons have sold for over $3 million per carat at auction.
        The combination of vivid green colour, good transparency, and
        fine texture in large pieces is exceptionally rare.

      - title: Treatments
        content: |
          Jadeite undergoes various treatments:

          - **Type A**: Natural, untreated (most valuable)
          - **Type B**: Bleached and polymer-impregnated
          - **Type B+C**: Bleached, dyed, and impregnated
          - **Type C**: Dyed (less common alone)

          Infrared spectroscopy detects polymer impregnation.

      type: warning
      title: Durability Concerns
      text: |
        Spodumene presents challenges for jewellery use:

        - **Perfect cleavage** in two directions at 90°
        - **Light sensitivity**: Some kunzite may fade
        - **Cutting difficulty**: Cleavage makes cutting challenging
        - **Care required**: Avoid knocks and ultrasonic

        Best used in earrings, pendants, or occasional-wear rings.
