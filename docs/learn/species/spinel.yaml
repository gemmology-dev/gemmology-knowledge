    content: |
      Spinel (MgAl₂O₄) is a magnesium aluminium oxide that produces gems in nearly every
      colour. Historically confused with ruby and sapphire, spinel has emerged as a
      prized gem in its own right, with fine red and cobalt-blue specimens commanding
      exceptional prices.

      The "great impostors" of history—the Black Prince's Ruby and Timur Ruby—are
      both red spinels, testament to their beauty rivaling ruby.

    subsections:
      - title: Red Spinel
        content: |
          The most valued spinel colour:

          - **Chromophore**: Chromium (Cr³⁺)
          - **Ideal colour**: Vivid red with slight pink or orange modifier
          - **Fluorescence**: Strong red under UV (like ruby)
          - **Distinction from ruby**: SR (no birefringence), lower RI, lower SG
          - **Trade names**: "Balas ruby" (historical)

      - title: Blue Spinel
        content: |
          Particularly cobalt-blue specimens:

          - **Cobalt blue**: Coloured by Co²⁺; vivid, saturated
          - **Iron blue**: Coloured by Fe; often greyish
          - **Sources**: Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Tanzania (cobalt)
          - **Value**: Fine cobalt-blue rivals ruby prices

      - title: Pink Spinel
        content: |
          Popular and relatively available:

          - **Chromophore**: Chromium (lower concentrations than red)

      title: Exceptional Blue
      text: |
        Cobalt-blue spinel is among the most valuable coloured gemstones.
        The vivid, saturated blue with no heat treatment commands prices
        exceeding $10,000 per carat for fine examples.

        True cobalt colour must be confirmed by spectroscopy—iron-blue
        spinels are much less valuable.

  - title: Historical Significance

      Spinel has a remarkable history of mistaken identity:
    subsections:
      - title: Famous "Rubies"
        content: |
          - **Black Prince's Ruby**: 170 ct red spinel in British Imperial State Crown
          - **Timur Ruby**: 352 ct red spinel with Persian inscriptions; Crown Jewels
          - **Samarian Spinel**: 500 ct; one of largest known spinels

          These stones were identified as spinels only with modern gemology.

      - title: Historical Importance
        content: |
          - Traded along Silk Road routes for millennia
          - "Balas ruby" referred to spinels from Badakhshan (Afghanistan/Tajikistan)
          - Prized by Mogul emperors
          - Confused with ruby until 18th-century mineralogical advances

  - title: Characteristic Inclusions
    content: |
      Spinel inclusions help separate natural from synthetic:
    subsections:
      - title: Natural Spinel Inclusions
        content: |
          - **Octahedral crystals**: Other spinels or negative crystals
          - **Fingerprints**: Healed fractures with fluid remnants
          - **Swallowtail twins**: Characteristic growth pattern
          - **Zircon with halos**: Common in Sri Lankan material
          - **Generally clean**: Spinel often has fewer inclusions than corundum

      - title: Synthetic Spinel Indicators
        content: |
          - **Gas bubbles**: Curved lines or scattered
          - **Strong ADR**: More pronounced than natural
          - **Unusual colours**: Especially colourless, blue (as diamond simulant)
          - **Too perfect**: Lack of natural features

  - title: Anomalous Double Refraction
    callout:
      type: tip
      title: ADR in Spinel
      text: |
        Natural spinel may show some ADR (anomalous double refraction) under
        the polariscope, but synthetic flame-fusion spinel typically shows
        much stronger, more pronounced ADR—a useful distinguishing feature.

        The "tabby extinction" pattern in synthetic spinel is often more
        dramatic than in natural material.

  - title: Treatments
    content: |
      Spinel is notable for being largely untreated:

      - **Heat treatment**: Rare; occasionally used to lighten dark stones
      - **No oiling or filling**: Not practiced
      - **No diffusion**: Not known in spinel
      - **Market position**: "Untreated" is standard expectation

      This untreated status adds to spinel's appeal for collectors.

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for spinel identification:

      - **RI**: 1.718 (single reading—isotropic)
      - **SG**: 3.60
      - **Optic character**: SR (stays dark in polariscope, or shows ADR)
      - **No pleochroism**: No colour change in dichroscope
      - **Spectrum**: Cr doublet at 686nm in red spinel
      - **Fluorescence**: Strong red in Cr-coloured stones
