  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Corundum (Al₂O₃) is one of the most important gem minerals, second only to diamond
      in hardness. It produces the world's most valuable coloured stones: ruby and sapphire.

      All corundum shares the same crystal structure and fundamental properties, with colour
      variations caused by trace element substitutions in the aluminium oxide lattice.

    subsections:
      - title: Crystal System and Structure
        content: |
          - **Crystal system**: Trigonal (hexagonal division)
          - **Chemical formula**: Al₂O₃ (aluminium oxide)
          - **Habit**: Typically hexagonal prisms, bipyramids, tabular
          - **Cleavage**: None (parting along twin planes)
          - **Fracture**: Conchoidal to uneven

  - title: Ruby
    content: |
      Ruby is the red variety of corundum, coloured by chromium (Cr³⁺). Fine rubies are
      among the rarest and most valuable of all gemstones.
    subsections:
      - title: Colour and Chromophores
        content: |
          - **Colour cause**: Chromium (Cr³⁺) substituting for aluminium
          - **Ideal colour**: "Pigeon blood" - vivid red with slight blue modifier
          - **Range**: Pinkish-red to purplish-red to orangey-red
          - **Fluorescence**: Strong red under UV (due to Cr)

          The distinction between ruby and pink sapphire is debated; most authorities
          require a certain saturation threshold for the ruby designation.

      title: The Lotus Blossom Sapphire
      text: |
        Padparadscha is the rarest and most valuable fancy sapphire, named from the
        Sinhalese word for lotus blossom. It must show both pink and orange colours
        simultaneously, with neither dominant.

        Traditionally from Sri Lanka, the term's definition is debated. Major labs
        have varying criteria, making certification important for high-value stones.

  - title: Star Corundum
    content: |
      Star rubies and star sapphires display asterism caused by oriented rutile silk.
    subsections:
      - title: Formation
        content: |
          - Rutile (TiO₂) needles oriented along crystal axes
          - Three sets of needles at 120° create six-ray star
          - Must be cut en cabochon with proper orientation
          - Rarely, twelve-ray stars occur (two overlapping six-ray patterns)

      - title: Quality Factors
        content: |
          - **Star sharpness**: Crisp, well-defined rays
          - **Star centering**: Star centred on dome
          - **Ray completeness**: Rays extend fully
          - **Movement**: Smooth, fluid motion with light
          - **Body colour**: Attractive underlying colour
          - **Transparency**: Semi-translucent to opaque

        - Inclusion
        - Appearance
        - Significance
      rows:
        - ["Rutile silk", "Fine needles, often in three directions", "Can indicate unheated; dissolved by strong heat"]
        - ["Fingerprints", "Healed fractures with fluid remnants", "Common; useful for origin determination"]
        - ["Crystal inclusions", "Various minerals (calcite, apatite, zircon)", "Help determine origin"]
        - ["Hexagonal zoning", "Angular colour banding", "Follows crystal growth"]
        - ["Twinning", "Lamellar patterns visible in polariscope", "Common; creates parting"]

  - title: Treatments
    content: |
      Corundum undergoes various treatments to improve appearance:
    subsections:
      - title: Heat Treatment
        content: |
          The most common treatment; improves colour and clarity:

          - **Low temperature**: Reduces silk, improves transparency
          - **High temperature**: Can lighten overly dark stones
          - **Flux healing**: Heals fractures with borax flux
          - **Prevalence**: Majority of market corundum is heated

          Detection: Dissolved silk, altered inclusions, stress fractures

      - title: Beryllium Diffusion
        content: |
          Beryllium penetrates deep into stone at high temperatures:

          - Creates or enhances yellow, orange, pink colours
          - Penetration is deeper than earlier Ti diffusion
          - Detection requires LIBS or LA-ICP-MS
          - Must be disclosed; lower value than untreated

      - title: Lead Glass Filling
        content: |
          Fractures filled with lead glass to improve clarity:

          - Creates dramatic improvement in heavily fractured rubies
          - Easily detected (flash effect, bubbles)
          - Durability concerns; low value
          - Common in low-end commercial rubies

      title: Famous Corundum
      text: |
        **DeLong Star Ruby** (100.32 ct): Famous American Museum star ruby;
        stolen in 1964 and later recovered.

        **Black Prince's Ruby**: Actually a red spinel, but historically called
        a ruby; set in British Imperial State Crown.

        **Kashmir Sapphires**: The 1881-1887 discovery at 15,000 feet produced
        some of history's finest sapphires, now essentially exhausted.

        **Padparadscha (Sri Lanka)**: Traditional source; finest examples
        command prices rivaling fine rubies.

    content: |
      Key features for corundum identification:

      - **RI**: 1.762-1.770 (distinctive range)
