    content: |
      Zoisite (Ca₂Al₃(SiO₄)₃(OH)) is a calcium aluminium silicate that produces
      several gem varieties. Tanzanite—the blue-violet variety found only in
      Tanzania—is by far the most important, having become one of the world's
      most popular coloured gemstones since its discovery in 1967.

  - title: Tanzanite
    content: |
      Tanzanite is the violet-blue variety of zoisite, coloured by vanadium.
      Found in only one location on Earth, it has become a major gemstone
      since its 1967 discovery.
    subsections:
      - title: Colour and Pleochroism
        content: |
          Tanzanite shows strong trichroism:

          - **Axis 1**: Blue
          - **Axis 2**: Purple/violet
          - **Axis 3**: Brown/burgundy (often heated away)

          The face-up colour depends on cutting orientation. Most stones are
          heat-treated to remove brown and enhance violet-blue.

      - title: Colour Grading
        content: |
          Tanzanite colour is graded by:

          - **Hue**: Blue to violet (pure blue most valuable)
          - **Saturation**: Vivid preferred
          - **Tone**: Medium to medium-dark
          - **"AAA" quality**: Trade term for finest blue

      - title: The Single Source
        content: |
          Tanzanite occurs only in a small area of Tanzania:

          - Merelani Hills, near Mt. Kilimanjaro
          - Deposit approximately 7 km long, 2 km wide
          - Geologically unique conditions
          - Finite supply concerns affect pricing
          - Estimates suggest 20-30 year supply at current rates

      title: A Modern Gemstone
      text: |
        Tanzanite was discovered in 1967 by Maasai tribesman Ali Juuyawatu.
        Initially thought to be sapphire, it was identified as gem zoisite.

        Tiffany & Co. named it "tanzanite" after Tanzania and launched it
        commercially in 1968. It quickly became one of the most popular
        coloured gemstones despite being known for only 50+ years.

  - title: Heat Treatment
    content: |
      Virtually all tanzanite is heat-treated:
    subsections:
      - title: Treatment Process
        content: |
          - Natural tanzanite often brownish or burgundy
          - Heating to 500-600°C removes brown
          - Enhances violet-blue colour
          - Treatment is permanent and stable
          - Assumed unless stated otherwise

      - title: Detection
        content: |
          Detecting heat treatment in tanzanite is difficult:

          - No reliable visual indicators
          - Some natural blue exists (minority)
          - Laboratory techniques can sometimes detect
          - Market assumes all is heated

    subsections:
      - title: Thulite
        content: |
          Pink to red opaque zoisite:

          - **Colour cause**: Manganese
          - **Character**: Opaque to translucent
          - **Uses**: Cabochons, carvings, beads
          - **Sources**: Norway (type locality), Austria, USA

      - title: Anyolite (Ruby-in-Zoisite)
        content: |
          Green zoisite with ruby inclusions:

          - **Character**: Green matrix with red ruby crystals
          - **Black inclusions**: Hornblende
          - **Source**: Tanzania
          - **Uses**: Carvings, cabochons, decorative objects
          - **Note**: Ruby usually not gem quality

      - title: Chrome Zoisite
        content: |
          - Rare green transparent zoisite
          - Coloured by chromium
          - Very limited availability
          - Collector interest

      title: Care Required
      text: |
        Tanzanite requires careful handling:

        - Hardness 6-7 (softer than sapphire)
        - Perfect cleavage in one direction
        - Sensitive to temperature shock
        - Avoid ultrasonic and steam cleaning
        - Not ideal for daily-wear rings
        - Best for earrings, pendants, occasional rings

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for tanzanite identification:

      - **RI**: 1.691-1.700 (useful range)
      - **SG**: 3.35
      - **Birefringence**: 0.008-0.013
      - **Pleochroism**: Strong trichroism (diagnostic)
      - **Single source**: Tanzania only
      - **Spectrum**: Vanadium-related features
