  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Opal (SiO₂·nH₂O) is a hydrated silica that produces one of nature's most
      spectacular optical phenomena: play of colour. Unlike crystalline gems,
      opal is amorphous, composed of orderly stacked silica spheres that
      diffract light into spectral colours.

      Australia dominates world opal production, producing over 90% of
      precious opal.

    subsections:
      - title: Structure
        content: |
          Opal is unique among gems:

          - **Not crystalline**: Amorphous (no crystal structure)
          - **Composition**: Hydrated silica (SiO₂·nH₂O)
          - **Water content**: 3-21% (typically 6-10%)
          - **Formation**: Low-temperature precipitation from silica-rich water

  - title: Play of Colour
    content: |
      Play of colour is opal's defining phenomenon—flashing spectral colours
      that shift as the stone moves.
    subsections:
      - title: Cause
        content: |
          - Uniform silica spheres (150-400nm diameter)
          - Regularly stacked in three-dimensional array
          - Light diffracts between sphere layers
          - Different sphere sizes produce different colours

          Larger spheres (>350nm) produce red; smaller spheres produce blue/violet.
          Regularity of stacking determines brightness.

      - title: Precious vs Common Opal
        content: |
          - **Precious opal**: Shows play of colour; regular sphere arrangement
          - **Common opal (potch)**: No play of colour; irregular spheres
          - **Fire opal**: Valued for body colour; play of colour optional

  - title: Opal Types by Body Tone
    subsections:
      - title: Black Opal
        content: |
          The most valuable opal type:

          - **Body tone**: Dark grey to black
          - **Effect**: Colours appear most vivid against dark background
          - **Source**: Lightning Ridge, Australia (premium)
          - **Value**: Highest among opal types

      - title: White Opal
        content: |
          - **Body tone**: White to light grey
          - **Effect**: Softer colour display
          - **Sources**: Coober Pedy (Australia), Mintabie
          - **Value**: Lower than black; still valuable if fine

      - title: Crystal Opal
        content: |
          - **Character**: Transparent to semi-transparent
          - **Effect**: Play of colour visible from both sides
          - **Body**: Clear to slightly milky
          - **Value**: High for good specimens

      - title: Boulder Opal
        content: |
          - **Character**: Opal in ironstone matrix
          - **Source**: Queensland, Australia
          - **Advantage**: Matrix provides stability
          - **Value**: Variable; fine material highly valued

      - title: Fire Opal
        content: |
          - **Body colour**: Yellow, orange, red
          - **Play of colour**: Optional; not required
          - **Source**: Mexico (primary)
          - **Value**: Based on body colour intensity

      title: Most Prized Pattern
      text: |
        Harlequin pattern—angular, mosaic-like patches of colour—is the most
        valuable opal pattern. A true harlequin black opal can command
        extraordinary prices, with exceptional examples selling for hundreds
        of thousands of dollars.

        The pattern should show distinct, regular patches with multiple colours.

  - title: Ethiopian (Welo) Opal
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Hydrophane Behaviour
      text: |
        Ethiopian opal is often hydrophane—it absorbs water, becoming more
        transparent when wet and returning to original appearance when dry.

        Concerns include:
        - Potential crazing (cracking) in some material
        - Colour change when wet
        - Treatment with smoke/oil possible
        - Lower prices than comparable Australian opal

        Quality Ethiopian opal can be stable and beautiful.

  - title: Treatments
    content: |
      Opal undergoes various treatments:

      - **Smoke treatment**: Darkens body tone (Ethiopian especially)
      - **Sugar/acid**: Historic treatment to darken
      - **Plastic impregnation**: Stabilises; must be disclosed
      - **Doublets/triplets**: Composite stones (not treatment per se)
      - **Oiling**: Temporary enhancement

  - title: Care and Stability
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Special Care Required
      text: |
        Opal requires careful handling:

        - **Water loss**: Can craze (crack) if dehydrated
        - **Heat shock**: Avoid sudden temperature changes
        - **Chemicals**: Avoid harsh chemicals
        - **Impact**: Softer than most gems; can chip
        - **Storage**: Keep with damp cotton in dry climates
        - **Cleaning**: Warm water only; no ultrasonic

        Avoid leaving opal in hot sun or dry conditions for extended periods.

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for opal identification:

      - **RI**: 1.37-1.47 (low; single reading)
      - **SG**: 1.98-2.25 (low)
      - **Play of colour**: Diagnostic for precious opal
      - **Amorphous**: SR; no crystal structure
      - **Water content**: Can affect stability
