  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Pearls are organic gems formed when a mollusc deposits concentric layers of
      nacre (aragonite crystals bound by conchiolin) around an irritant. They are
      the most commercially important organic gems and the only gems created by
      living creatures.

      Nearly all pearls in today's market are cultured—human-initiated by inserting
      a bead nucleus or tissue. Natural pearls are extremely rare and primarily
      found in antique jewellery.

      Understanding how pearls form:
    subsections:
      - title: Natural Pearls
        content: |
          - Form spontaneously without human intervention
          - Irritant (often parasite) enters mantle tissue
          - Mollusc secretes nacre layers around irritant
          - Takes years to form
          - Extremely rare today

      - title: Cultured Pearls
        content: |
          - Human-initiated by inserting nucleus
          - Bead-nucleated: Shell bead with mantle tissue
          - Tissue-nucleated: Mantle tissue only
          - Same nacre deposition process as natural
          - **Both natural and cultured are real pearls**

      - title: Nacre Composition
        content: |
          - **Aragonite**: Calcium carbonate crystals (brick-like platelets)
          - **Conchiolin**: Organic binder between layers
          - **Structure**: Overlapping platelets create iridescence
          - **Thickness**: Quality indicator; thicker is better

  - title: Freshwater Pearls
    content: |
      Freshwater pearls are cultivated primarily in China:
    subsections:
      - title: Characteristics
        content: |
          - **Mollusc**: Hyriopsis cumingii (triangle mussel)
          - **Nucleation**: Often tissue-only (solid nacre)
          - **Shapes**: From baroque to near-round to round
          - **Colours**: White, pink, lavender, peach
          - **Production**: One mussel can produce 20-50 pearls

      - title: Modern Developments
        content: |
          - **Edison pearls**: Bead-nucleated; large, round
          - **Ming pearls**: High-quality round freshwater
          - Quality now rivals saltwater in best examples
          - Price remains lower than saltwater equivalents

      headers:
        - Factor
        - Description
        - Premium Quality
      rows:
        - ["Lustre", "Surface reflection and inner glow", "Mirror-like with depth"]
        - ["Surface", "Blemishes, spots, pits", "Clean or near-clean"]

  - title: Lustre is Paramount

      title: Most Important Factor
      text: |
        Lustre is the most critical pearl quality factor. A smaller pearl with
        excellent lustre will outvalue a larger pearl with dull, chalky lustre.

        Fine lustre shows:
        - Sharp light reflections
        - Sense of depth (light from within)
        - Mirror-like surface quality
        - Strong contrast between light and shadow

  - title: Colour Components
    content: |
      Pearl colour has three parts:
    subsections:
      - title: Body Colour
        content: |
          The main background colour:
          - White, cream, silver, gold, black, grey
          - Pink, peach, lavender in some varieties
          - Natural vs dyed colours

      - title: Overtone
        content: |
          A translucent secondary colour:
          - Rose (pink) overtone on white pearls
          - Green or peacock overtone on Tahitian
          - Adds depth and value

      - title: Orient
        content: |
          Iridescent rainbow effect:
          - Caused by nacre platelet interference
          - Most visible in fine nacre
          - Sign of quality

        - Imitation
      rows:
        - ["Tooth test", "Gritty, slightly rough", "Smooth or glassy"]
        - ["Surface texture", "Tiny scale-like platelets", "Too perfect or painted"]
        - ["Drill hole", "Nacre visible all around", "Coating may flake"]

      title: Distinguishing Natural Pearls
      text: |
        Laboratory tests distinguish natural from cultured:

        - **X-ray**: Shows bead nucleus in cultured pearls
        - **X-ray luminescence**: Different patterns
        - **Candling**: Light transmission reveals structure

        Natural pearls show concentric growth layers throughout;
        bead-nucleated cultured pearls show the bead core.

  - title: Treatments
    content: |
      Common pearl treatments:

      - **Bleaching**: Lightens colour; very common
      - **Dyeing**: Adds colour; should be disclosed
      - **Irradiation**: Darkens nuclei (creates dark colours)
      - **Lustre enhancement**: Coatings; temporary
      - **Filling**: Repairs damaged nacre; quality issue

      title: Special Care Required
      text: |
        Pearls require special handling:

        - **Acids**: Avoid perfume, hairspray, cosmetics
        - **Chemicals**: No household cleaners
        - **Heat**: Avoid extreme temperatures
        - **Drying**: Store with humidity (damp cloth nearby)
        - **Cleaning**: Warm water and mild soap only
        - **Wear**: Put on last, remove first
        - **Storage**: Separate from harder gems

        Hardness 2.5-4.5; easily scratched.
