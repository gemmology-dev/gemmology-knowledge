  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      The amphibole group includes nephrite, one of the two minerals historically
      called "jade." While less valuable than jadeite, nephrite has been treasured
      for millennia, particularly in Chinese and Māori cultures, for its exceptional
      toughness and subtle beauty.

      Nephrite is composed of interlocking fibrous crystals of actinolite and
      tremolite, making it the toughest natural material known.

  - title: Nephrite
    content: |
      Nephrite is a variety of actinolite-tremolite, prized for its toughness
      and carving qualities.

      - title: Colour Varieties
        content: |
          Nephrite occurs in various colours:

          - **Green**: Iron content; most common
          - **White ("mutton fat")**: Pure tremolite; prized in China
          - **Brown**: Higher iron; weathered surfaces
          - **Black**: High iron content
          - **Yellow**: Iron oxidation

      - title: Tremolite vs Actinolite
        content: |
          Nephrite composition varies:

          - **Tremolite**: Mg-rich; tends to white/cream colours
          - **Actinolite**: Fe-substituted; tends to green colours
          - Most nephrite is intermediate
          - Colour correlates with composition

  - title: Exceptional Toughness

      title: Toughest Natural Material
      text: |
        Nephrite's interlocking fibrous structure makes it tougher than steel.
        This exceptional toughness made it valuable for prehistoric tools and
        weapons—the name "jade" comes from Spanish "piedra de ijada" (stone
        of the side), referring to its supposed healing properties.

        Archaeological nephrite axes show minimal damage despite heavy use.

      title: Hetian Jade
      text: |
        White nephrite from Hetian (Khotan) in Xinjiang, China, is the most
        valued jade in Chinese culture—more so than green jadeite. Called
        "mutton fat jade" for its warm, creamy appearance, fine Hetian nephrite
        has been treasured for over 5,000 years.

        River-worn pebbles ("seed jade") command higher prices than mined material.

  - title: Care and Durability
    content: |
      Despite toughness, nephrite requires some care:

      - Avoid harsh chemicals
      - Clean with warm soapy water
      - Ultrasonic generally safe (solid pieces)
      - Can be oiled to enhance lustre
      - Surface can be scratched (H 6-6.5)
      - Excellent for carvings and daily-wear jewellery
