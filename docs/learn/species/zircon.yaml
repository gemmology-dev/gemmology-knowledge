  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Zircon (ZrSiO₄) is a zirconium silicate with exceptional brilliance and
      dispersion. Often confused with cubic zirconia (CZ), natural zircon is a
      completely different material—one of the oldest minerals on Earth, with
      specimens dating back 4.4 billion years.

      The December birthstone in its blue form, zircon offers diamond-like
      sparkle at a fraction of the price.

  - title: Metamict Zircon
    content: |
      Zircon contains trace radioactive elements (uranium, thorium) that cause
      internal radiation damage over geological time.
    subsections:
      - title: The Metamict Process
        content: |
          - Radioactive decay damages crystal structure
          - Progressive breakdown from crystalline to amorphous
          - Properties change as structure deteriorates
          - Process takes millions to billions of years

            - ["Intermediate", "Partially damaged", "Intermediate properties"]
            - ["Low zircon (metamict)", "Largely amorphous", "Reduced RI, SG, birefringence"]

      - title: Restoration
        content: |
          Heat treatment can restore metamict zircon:

          - Heating to ~1000°C can recrystallize the structure
          - Restores high RI, SG, birefringence
          - Also changes colour in many cases
          - Process is permanent and stable

  - title: Colour Varieties
    subsections:
      - title: Blue Zircon
        content: |
          The most popular zircon colour:

          - **Origin**: Heat treatment of brown zircon
          - **Colour**: Light to vivid blue
          - **Treatment**: Universal (virtually all blue zircon is heated)
          - **Stability**: Permanent
          - **Sources**: Cambodia, Sri Lanka

      - title: Colourless Zircon
        content: |
          Excellent diamond simulant:

          - **High dispersion**: 0.039 (approaches diamond's 0.044)
          - **High RI**: Creates strong brilliance
          - **Historic use**: Diamond substitute before CZ
          - **Distinction from diamond**: Lower hardness, high birefringence

      type: tip
      title: Doubling Effect
      text: |
        Zircon's high birefringence (0.059) creates visible doubling of back
        facets when viewed through the table. This diagnostic feature:

        - Distinguishes zircon from diamond (SR)
        - Visible with 10× loupe
        - Creates slightly "fuzzy" appearance
        - More obvious in larger stones

        The doubling appears as duplicate edges of pavilion facets.

    content: |
      Understanding blue zircon treatment:
    subsections:
      - title: Treatment Process
        content: |
          - Brown Cambodian/Sri Lankan zircon selected
          - Heated in reducing atmosphere (oxygen-free)
          - Temperatures around 900-1000°C
          - Colour change to blue occurs
          - Process also restores metamict material

      - title: Stability
        content: |
          - Colour is permanent
          - Does not fade with light or heat
          - Treatment universally accepted
          - Disclosure standard but not always practiced
          - Assume all blue zircon is heated

  - title: Characteristic Inclusions
    content: |
      Zircon inclusions can be diagnostic:

      - **Parallel growth lines**: Common in natural zircon
      - **Doublet reflections**: All inclusions appear doubled
      - **"Treacle" effect**: Metamict areas may show different texture
      - **Radiation halos**: Zircon crystals in other gems show halos
      - **Mineral inclusions**: Apatite, monazite common

  - title: Zircon Halos

      type: info
      title: Diagnostic in Other Gems
      text: |
        When zircon appears as an inclusion in other gems (sapphire, garnet),
        its radioactive content creates tension halos or dark haloes around
        the crystal. These "zircon halos" help identify the host gem's
        formation conditions and sometimes its geographic origin.

      - **Birefringence**: 0.059 (very high; visible doubling)
      - **Dispersion**: 0.039 (high fire)
