  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Feldspars are the most abundant minerals in Earth's crust, and several members
      produce important gem materials. The group is notable for spectacular optical
      phenomena including adularescence (moonstone), labradorescence, and aventurescence
      (sunstone).

      Feldspars divide into two main series: alkali feldspars (potassium/sodium)
      and plagioclase feldspars (sodium/calcium).

  - title: Moonstone
    content: |
      Moonstone displays adularescence—a soft, billowy glow that appears to float
      just below the surface.
    subsections:
      - title: Cause of Adularescence
        content: |
          - Alternating layers of orthoclase and albite
          - Layers form during cooling (exsolution)
          - Layer thickness determines colour: thin = blue; thicker = white
          - Best effect requires ~0.1 μm layers

          rows:
            - ["Classical moonstone", "Orthoclase", "Blue-white schiller", "Colourless to grey"]
            - ["Rainbow moonstone", "Labradorite", "Multicoloured flashes", "Translucent white"]
            - ["Peach moonstone", "Orthoclase", "White schiller", "Peach to orange"]

      - title: Quality Factors
        content: |
          - **Schiller colour**: Blue is most prized
          - **Intensity**: Strong, visible adularescence
          - **Body colour**: Colourless preferred
          - **Transparency**: More transparent = higher value
          - **Centred effect**: Schiller centred on dome

      - title: Sources
        content: |
          - **Sri Lanka**: Finest blue moonstone (historic)
          - **India**: Large production; variable quality
          - **Myanmar**: Some fine material
          - **Tanzania**: Good quality moonstones

  - title: Blue Moonstone

      type: info
      title: Premium Quality
      text: |
        Fine blue moonstone with strong adularescence and good transparency
        commands significant premiums. The blue schiller should appear to
        float within the stone, moving as the gem is tilted.

        True orthoclase moonstone is distinguished from "rainbow moonstone"
        (actually labradorite) which shows multicoloured flashes.

  - title: Labradorite
    content: |
      Labradorite displays labradorescence—striking plays of colour including
      blue, green, gold, and purple.
    subsections:
      - title: Cause of Labradorescence
        content: |
          - Light interference from lamellar twinning
          - Twin lamellae of varying thickness
          - Colours appear in patches or broad flashes
          - Best seen on specific crystal planes

      - title: Spectrolite
        content: |
          Finnish labradorite showing full spectral colours:

          - Vivid blues, greens, oranges, purples
          - Displays most of the visible spectrum
          - Premium prices for fine examples
          - Discovered in Finland during WWII

  - title: Sunstone
    content: |
      Sunstone displays aventurescence—a glittery, metallic reflection from
      included platelets.
    subsections:
      - title: Cause of Aventurescence
        content: |
          Reflective inclusions cause the sparkle:

          - **Oregon sunstone**: Copper platelets (unique)
          - **Indian sunstone**: Hematite or goethite platelets
          - **Norwegian sunstone**: Hematite platelets

      - title: Oregon Sunstone
        content: |
          Unique copper-bearing feldspar:

          - Only source of copper-included feldspar
          - Can show strong red/green dichroism
          - Some stones are transparent without schiller
          - Bicolour and tricolour specimens exist
          - Premium for strong copper "schiller"

      - title: Quality Factors
        content: |
          - **Evenness**: Well-distributed sparkle
          - **Intensity**: Strong metallic effect
          - **Body colour**: Can add value (Oregon reds)
          - **Transparency**: Some prefer transparency; others prefer schiller

  - title: Amazonite
    content: |
      Blue-green microcline feldspar:

      - **Colour cause**: Lead and water in structure
      - **Colour range**: Blue-green to green
      - **Character**: Opaque to translucent
      - **Uses**: Cabochons, carvings, beads
      - **Sources**: Brazil, Russia (Urals), Colorado, Madagascar

      title: Setting and Wear
      text: |
        All feldspars have perfect cleavage in two directions, making them:

        - Vulnerable to chipping
        - Best in protective settings
        - Unsuitable for hard daily wear
        - Requiring careful cutting

        Ring use should be occasional; pendants and earrings are safer choices.

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for feldspar identification:

      - **RI**: 1.518-1.588 (variable by species)

      - **Cleavage**: Two directions at ~90°
      - **Phenomena**: Diagnostic (adularescence, labradorescence)
      - **Twinning**: Common; visible under polariscope
