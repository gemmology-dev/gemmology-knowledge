  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Garnets are a group of silicate minerals sharing a common crystal structure but
      varying in chemical composition. The group produces gems in virtually every colour
      except blue, from the common red almandine to the rare and valuable demantoid.

      Understanding garnet requires recognizing it as a mineral group, not a single species.
      Most gem garnets are solid solutions between end-member compositions.

      Garnets divide into two main series that can intergrade:

      title: ADR in Garnets
      text: |
        Despite being cubic (and therefore isotropic), many garnets show anomalous
        double refraction (ADR) under the polariscope. This strain birefringence
        results from internal stress during rapid growth or compositional variations.

        ADR appears as patchy light/dark patterns instead of staying uniformly dark.
        It's particularly common in almandine and is not a sign of misidentification.

      Andradite includes the most valuable of all garnets:
    subsections:
      - title: Demantoid
        content: |
          Green andradite, the "king of garnets":

          Russian demantoids are prized for "horsetail" inclusions:

          - Byssolite (fibrous amphibole) radiating from a point
          - Considered diagnostic for Ural origin
          - Presence adds value (unusual for inclusions)
          - Non-Russian demantoid typically lacks horsetails

      title: The King of Garnets
      text: |
        Fine Russian demantoids with horsetail inclusions command prices rivaling
        fine emeralds. The combination of vivid green colour, exceptional dispersion
        (fire), and characteristic inclusions makes them highly collectible.

        Stones over 1 carat are rare; over 3 carats exceptionally so.

  - title: Colour-Change Garnet
    content: |
      Some garnets show alexandrite-like colour change:

      - **Type**: Usually pyrope-spessartine mixes
      - **Change**: Blue-green (daylight) to red-purple (incandescent)
      - **Cause**: Vanadium and/or chromium
      - **Sources**: Madagascar, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, USA
      - **Rarity**: Exceptionally rare; highly valued

      - title: Separating from Similar Gems
        content: |
          - **Garnet vs Ruby**: Garnet is SR, no pleochroism
          - **Tsavorite vs Emerald**: Garnet is SR; different RI
          - **Demantoid vs Peridot**: Demantoid SR; much higher RI
          - **Spessartine vs Citrine**: RI easily distinguishes
