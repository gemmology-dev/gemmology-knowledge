  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Chrysoberyl (BeAl₂O₄) is a beryllium aluminate that produces two of the most
      remarkable gem phenomena: alexandrite's colour change and the finest cat's eye
      effect. Despite the name, chrysoberyl is not related to beryl.

      Alexandrite and fine cat's eye chrysoberyl are among the rarest and most
      valuable coloured stones.

    subsections:
      - title: Crystal System and Structure
        content: |
          - **Crystal system**: Orthorhombic
          - **Chemical formula**: BeAl₂O₄
          - **Habit**: Tabular crystals, often cyclic twins
          - **Cleavage**: Good in one direction
          - **Twinning**: Trillings (three-part twins) common

          headers:
            - Property
            - Value
          rows:
            - ["Hardness", "8.5 Mohs"]

            - ["Lustre", "Vitreous"]

  - title: Ordinary Chrysoberyl
    content: |
      Non-phenomenal chrysoberyl occurs in various colours:

      - **Yellow to golden**: Most common gem chrysoberyl
      - **Green**: Without colour change
      - **Brown**: Less desirable
      - **Colourless**: Rare

      Properties: Hard, durable, good brilliance. Less valuable than
      alexandrite or cat's eye but an excellent gem material.

  - title: Alexandrite
    content: |
      Alexandrite is colour-change chrysoberyl, one of the most remarkable
      and valuable gem phenomena.
    subsections:
      - title: The Colour Change
        content: |
          - **Daylight/fluorescent**: Green to blue-green
          - **Incandescent**: Red to purple-red
          - **Cause**: Chromium (Cr³⁺) absorption spectrum

          The alexandrite effect occurs because chromium creates a
          transmission window between red and green, and light sources
          with different spectral compositions reveal different colours.

      - title: Grading Colour Change
        content: |
          Colour change is assessed as percentage shift:

          - **100%**: Complete change (green ↔ red, no overlap)
          - **75-99%**: Strong colour change
          - **50-74%**: Moderate colour change
          - **<50%**: Weak colour change

          Both colours should be attractive; muddy colours reduce value.

      - title: Trichroism
        content: |
          Alexandrite shows strong trichroism:

          - Green / orange / purple-red in three directions
          - Visible with dichroscope
          - Affects face-up colour depending on cut orientation
          - Diagnostic feature for natural alexandrite

      title: The Classic Standard
      text: |
        Russian (Ural) alexandrite discovered in 1830 set the standard for
        colour change. The green matched the Russian military colour; the
        red honoured the Tsar.

        Fine Russian alexandrites are essentially unavailable today. Stones
        with documented Russian origin command extraordinary premiums when
        they appear at auction.

  - title: Cat's Eye Chrysoberyl
    content: |
      Chrysoberyl cat's eye (cymophane) shows the finest chatoyancy of any gem.
    subsections:
      - title: The Chatoyant Band
        content: |
          - **Cause**: Parallel silk (needle inclusions)
          - **Effect**: Single sharp band of light
          - **Quality**: Sharpest, most defined of any cat's eye
          - **Cut**: Must be en cabochon perpendicular to needles

      - title: The Milk and Honey Effect
        content: |
          When lit from one side, fine cat's eye shows:

          - **"Milk" side**: Lighter, more opaque
          - **"Honey" side**: Darker, more transparent
          - Indicates dense, even silk distribution
          - Sign of highest quality

      - title: Quality Factors
        table:
          headers:
            - Factor
            - Premium Quality
          rows:
            - ["Eye sharpness", "Crisp, knife-edge line"]
            - ["Eye movement", "Smooth, fluid motion"]
            - ["Body colour", "Honey yellow to greenish"]
            - ["Milk and honey", "Strong contrast when side-lit"]
            - ["Transparency", "Translucent (not too opaque)"]

      - title: Nomenclature
        content: |
          Only chrysoberyl may be called simply "cat's eye"—all other
          chatoyant gems require qualification:

          - "Cat's eye" = chrysoberyl cat's eye
          - "Quartz cat's eye" = chatoyant quartz
          - "Tourmaline cat's eye" = chatoyant tourmaline

      title: Premier Chatoyant Gem
      text: |
        Fine cat's eye chrysoberyl with sharp eye, milk and honey effect,
        and good honey body colour is extremely valuable. Large stones
        (over 5 carats) with excellent eyes can rival alexandrite prices.

        The term "cymophane" (Greek for "wavelike appearance") is sometimes
        used for gem-quality cat's eye chrysoberyl.

  - title: Synthetic and Simulants

      Be aware of synthetics and simulants:
    subsections:
      - title: Synthetic Alexandrite
        content: |
          - Czochralski-pulled alexandrite exists
          - Shows colour change but often different colours
          - May show curved striae or gas bubbles
          - Flux-grown synthetic also produced

      - title: Colour-Change Simulants
        content: |
          - Synthetic corundum with colour change
          - Synthetic spinel with colour change
          - Both lack chrysoberyl's RI and SG
          - Chemical composition differs

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for chrysoberyl identification:

      - **RI**: 1.746-1.755 (distinctive range)
      - **SG**: 3.73 (characteristic)
      - **Birefringence**: 0.008-0.010
      - **Hardness**: 8.5 (very hard)
      - **Trichroism**: Strong in alexandrite
      - **Colour change**: Diagnostic for alexandrite
      - **Chatoyancy**: Superior in cat's eye
