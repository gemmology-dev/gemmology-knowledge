  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Quartz (SiO₂) is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and one of the
      most versatile gem materials. It occurs in two main forms: macrocrystalline
      (visible crystals) and cryptocrystalline (chalcedony varieties).

      Despite its commonality, fine quartz specimens—particularly amethyst and
      well-coloured citrine—remain popular and valuable.

    subsections:
      - title: Amethyst
        content: |
          Purple to violet quartz:

      title: Natural Bicolour
      text: |
        Ametrine displays both amethyst purple and citrine yellow in the same
        crystal. Virtually all commercial ametrine comes from the Anahí mine
        in Bolivia, where unique geological conditions create this bicolour effect.

        Synthetic ametrine exists, so certification may be valuable for fine pieces.

      title: Hydrothermal Synthesis
      text: |
        Synthetic quartz is grown hydrothermally for electronics (oscillators).
        Gem-quality synthetic quartz exists, including synthetic amethyst and
        citrine. Distinguishing features:

        - Unusual colour uniformity
        - Lack of natural inclusions
        - Specific growth patterns (chevron zoning)
        - Very clean compared to natural

        Natural Brazilian amethyst often has Angola-law twinning visible
        in the polariscope, absent in synthetics.

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for quartz identification:

      - **RI**: 1.544-1.553 (distinctive)
      - **SG**: 2.65 (constant)
      - **Birefringence**: 0.009
      - **Hardness**: 7 (scratches glass easily)
      - **No cleavage**: Conchoidal fracture
      - **Bull's eye**: Interference figure with cross and rings
