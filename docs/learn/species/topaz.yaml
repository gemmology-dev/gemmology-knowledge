    content: |
      Topaz (Al₂SiO₄(F,OH)₂) is an aluminium fluorosilicate prized for its excellent
      hardness, brilliance, and variety of colours. While blue topaz dominates the
      commercial market, the rare imperial topaz from Brazil commands premium prices.

      Topaz has been known since antiquity, though historically the name was applied
      to various yellow gems including peridot and citrine.

      type: warning
      title: Perfect Basal Cleavage
      text: |
        Topaz has perfect cleavage in one direction, making it vulnerable to
        chipping if struck. This requires care in:

        - Cutting and polishing
        - Setting (protective settings recommended)
        - Daily wear (avoid hard impacts)
        - Cleaning (avoid ultrasonic)

        Despite H8 hardness, this cleavage makes topaz more fragile than corundum.

  - title: Colour Varieties
    subsections:
      - title: Imperial Topaz
        content: |
          The most valuable topaz variety:

          - **Colour**: Orange to pink-orange to reddish-orange
          - **Source**: Primarily Ouro Preto, Brazil
          - **Cause**: Chromium in some; colour centres
          - **Rarity**: True imperial colour is rare
          - **Value**: Commands significant premiums

          The term "imperial" should be reserved for the finest orange to
          pinkish-orange colours, not ordinary yellow or golden topaz.

      - title: Sherry Topaz
        content: |
          Yellowish-brown to orange-brown:

          - **Colour**: Named for sherry wine colour
          - **Sources**: Brazil, Sri Lanka, Pakistan
          - **Note**: May fade with light exposure
          - **Value**: Lower than imperial; higher than colourless

      - title: Blue Topaz
        content: |
          The most common market topaz today:

          - **Natural**: Rare and typically pale
          - **Treated**: Virtually all commercial blue topaz
          - **Treatment**: Irradiation + heat
          - **Trade names**: Sky Blue (light), Swiss Blue (medium), London Blue (dark)

      - title: Pink Topaz
        content: |
          - **Natural**: Extremely rare
          - **Treated**: Heat-treated from brownish or yellowish material
          - **Source**: Brazil, Pakistan (natural pink rare)
          - **Value**: High for natural; moderate for treated

      - title: Colourless Topaz
        content: |
          - **Abundance**: Common; often treated to blue
          - **Historic**: Used as diamond simulant
          - **Value**: Lowest of topaz varieties
          - **Uses**: Starting material for treatment

      Understanding treated blue topaz:
    subsections:
      - title: Treatment Process
        content: |
          Virtually all blue topaz on the market is treated:

          1. Start with colourless topaz (abundant)
          2. Irradiate (various methods produce different blues)
          3. Heat to stabilize and develop colour
          4. Hold for radiation decay (if neutron-irradiated)

        table:
          headers:
            - Trade Name
            - Colour
            - Treatment
          rows:
            - ["Sky Blue", "Light, clear blue", "Electron or gamma irradiation"]
            - ["Swiss Blue", "Medium saturated blue", "Combination irradiation"]
            - ["London Blue", "Deep greyish-blue", "Neutron irradiation + heat"]

      - title: Safety Note
        content: |
          Neutron-irradiated topaz (London Blue) must be held for radiation
          decay before sale. Reputable suppliers ensure this, but the delay
          period can be months.

  - title: Characteristic Inclusions
    content: |
      Topaz typically has good clarity; when inclusions occur:

      - **Two-phase inclusions**: Liquid with gas bubble
      - **Growth tubes**: Parallel to c-axis
      - **Cleavage planes**: May show iridescence
      - **Needle inclusions**: Fine parallel needles
      - **Crystal inclusions**: Various minerals

  - title: Historical Notes

      title: Nomenclature History
      text: |
        Historical "topaz" often referred to other gems:

        - **"Oriental topaz"**: Actually yellow sapphire (deprecated)
        - **"Spanish topaz"**: Actually citrine
        - **"Smoky topaz"**: Actually smoky quartz

        Modern nomenclature reserves "topaz" strictly for Al₂SiO₄(F,OH)₂.
        The island of Topazios (now Zabargad) in the Red Sea, once thought
        to be the name source, actually produced peridot, not topaz.

  - title: Identification Summary
    content: |
      Key features for topaz identification:

      - **RI**: 1.619-1.627 (useful range)
      - **SG**: 3.53 (overlaps diamond!)
      - **Birefringence**: 0.008-0.010
      - **Optic sign**: Biaxial positive
      - **Cleavage**: Perfect basal (visible under magnification)
      - **Spectrum**: Often no diagnostic features
