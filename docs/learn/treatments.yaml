  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Most coloured gemstones on the market today have undergone some form of treatment
      to enhance their appearance. Understanding treatments is essential for accurate
      identification and proper disclosure.
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Disclosure Requirement
      text: |
        All gemstone treatments must be disclosed at the point of sale. Major laboratories
        (GIA, Gubelin, SSEF) provide treatment reports. Undisclosed treatments are
        considered fraudulent.

  - title: Heat Treatment
    content: |
      The most common treatment, heat treatment permanently alters colour and clarity
      by modifying the chemical state of chromophores or dissolving silk inclusions.

        - ["Blue sapphire", "Improves blue colour, dissolves silk", "1400-1800°C"]
        - ["Ruby", "Improves red colour, dissolves silk", "1200-1800°C"]
        - ["Tanzanite", "Changes brown to blue-violet", "450-650°C"]

        - ["Citrine", "Heat-treated amethyst", "450-500°C"]

    subsections:
      - title: Detection Signs
        content: |
          - Dissolved or partially dissolved silk (dotted lines)
          - Stress fractures around solid inclusions
          - Altered/melted inclusions
          - "Halo" fractures around zircon crystals
          - Colour concentrations along fractures
          - Altered absorption spectrum

  - title: Fracture Filling
    content: |
      Surface-reaching fractures are filled with glass, oil, or resin to improve
      apparent clarity. This treatment requires special care in handling.
    table:

      headers:
        - Filler Type
        - Gemstone
        - Stability
      rows:
        - ["Oil (cedar oil)", "Emerald", "Can dry out over time"]
        - ["Opticon/resin", "Emerald", "More stable than oil"]
        - ["Lead glass", "Ruby, Sapphire", "Damaged by heat, acids"]
        - ["Polymer resins", "Various", "Variable"]
    subsections:
      - title: Detection Signs
        content: |
          - Flash effect (orange/blue flashes in fractures)
          - Gas bubbles in filler
          - Flow structures
          - Different RI in filled areas
          - Blue glow under UV (some resins)

  - title: Lead Glass-Filled Rubies
    callout:
      type: error
      title: Lead Glass-Filled Rubies
      text: |
        Heavily fractured, low-quality ruby is sometimes filled with high-RI lead glass.
        These stones can contain more glass than ruby and are extremely fragile. They
        are damaged by heat, ultrasonic cleaning, and even lemon juice.

  - title: Diffusion Treatment
    content: |
      Elements are diffused into the stone at high temperatures to alter colour.
      This can be shallow (surface) or deep (lattice diffusion).
    table:

      headers:
        - Type
        - Element
        - Result
      rows:
        - ["Surface diffusion", "Titanium (Ti)", "Blue colour in sapphire (shallow)"]
        - ["Lattice diffusion", "Beryllium (Be)", "Orange/yellow/pink sapphire (deep)"]
        - ["Lattice diffusion", "Cobalt (Co)", "Blue glass-filled stones"]
    subsections:
      - title: Detection Methods
        content: |
          - **Surface diffusion**: Immersion reveals colour concentration along facet edges and girdle
          - **Beryllium diffusion**: LIBS or LA-ICP-MS analysis required for definitive detection
          - Colour distribution patterns may indicate treatment

        - ["Dyeing", "Colour added to porous stones", "Colour concentrations, swab test"]

  - title: Irradiation
    content: |
      Exposure to radiation (gamma rays, electrons, neutrons) can create or modify colour.
