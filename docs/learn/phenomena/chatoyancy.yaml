  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Chatoyancy is a single band of light that moves across a cabochon surface,
      resembling a cat's eye. It requires parallel needle or tube inclusions
      oriented in one direction, creating reflection along a single axis.

      Chrysoberyl cat's eye produces the finest chatoyancy of any gem and is
      the only gem that may be called simply "cat's eye" without qualification.

  - title: Mechanism
    content: |
      How chatoyancy forms:
    subsections:
      - title: Requirements
        content: |
          - Parallel fibrous or tubular inclusions
          - Must be cut en cabochon **perpendicular** to inclusion direction
          - Light reflects from the sides of inclusions
          - Creates a single bright band (chatoyant band)

      - title: Comparison with Asterism
        content: |
          - **Chatoyancy**: ONE set of parallel inclusions → single band
          - **Asterism**: Multiple sets at angles → star pattern
          - Same reflection principle; different inclusion arrangement

  - title: Chrysoberyl Cat's Eye
    content: |
      Chrysoberyl cat's eye (cymophane) is the finest and most valuable chatoyant gem.
    subsections:
      - title: Characteristics
        content: |
          - Strong, sharp chatoyant band
          - Honey yellow to green body colour
          - Fine, dense silk creates superior effect
          - Only chrysoberyl may be called simply "cat's eye"
          - All others require qualification (e.g., "quartz cat's eye")

      - title: The Silk
        content: |
          - Extremely fine parallel needle inclusions
          - Creates exceptionally sharp eye
          - Denser silk = sharper eye
          - May be hollow tubes or solid needles

  - title: The Milk and Honey Effect

      title: Sign of Quality
      text: |
        In fine chrysoberyl cat's eye, when lit from one side, the chatoyant
        band divides the stone into two zones:

        - **"Milk" side**: Lighter, more opaque
        - **"Honey" side**: Darker, more transparent

        This effect indicates dense, even silk distribution and is a
        hallmark of top-quality cat's eye chrysoberyl.

      Tiger's eye quartz is the most common chatoyant gem:
    subsections:

          - Originally fibrous crocidolite (blue asbestos)
          - Replaced by quartz while preserving fibrous structure
          - Retains golden-brown colour from iron staining

      title: Correct Naming
      text: |
        Only chrysoberyl may be called "cat's eye" without qualification.
        All other chatoyant gems MUST include the species name:

        - **Correct**: "Cat's eye" (chrysoberyl implied)
        - **Correct**: "Quartz cat's eye"
        - **Correct**: "Tourmaline cat's eye"
        - **Incorrect**: "Cat's eye tourmaline" (confusing order)
        - **Incorrect**: Just "cat's eye" for non-chrysoberyl

  - title: Cutting Considerations
    content: |
      Proper cutting maximises chatoyancy:

      - **Orientation**: Perpendicular to needle direction
      - **Dome shape**: Adequate height for light interaction
      - **Centering**: Eye should appear centred
      - **Symmetry**: Even cabochon shape
      - **Base**: Properly proportioned
