  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Aventurescence is a glittery, metallic reflection from flat, reflective inclusions
      within a gem. The effect is named after aventurine glass (from Italian "avventura"
      meaning chance), which was discovered accidentally when copper filings fell into
      molten glass.

      The sparkle comes from light reflecting off platy inclusions—typically metallic
      or reflective mineral flakes oriented within the host crystal.

      How aventurescence forms:
    subsections:
      - title: Requirements
        content: |
          - Flat, platy, reflective inclusions
          - Inclusions oriented parallel or sub-parallel
          - Sufficient inclusion density for visible effect
          - Transparent to translucent host material

      - title: Inclusion Types
        content: |
          Different minerals create aventurescence:

          - **Copper** (Oregon sunstone): Metallic orange-red sparkle
          - **Hematite/goethite** (Indian sunstone): Red-brown sparkle
          - **Fuchsite mica** (aventurine quartz): Green sparkle
          - **Pyrite/mica** (other gems): Variable sparkle

  - title: Sunstone

      Sunstone is feldspar with metallic schiller from oriented platelets:

          Unique copper-bearing feldspar:

          - **Inclusions**: Copper metal platelets
          - **Effect**: Metallic orange-red to golden sparkle
          - **Colours**: Colourless to green to red body
          - **Unique**: Only copper sunstone in the world
          - **Varieties**: Some transparent without schiller

      - title: Indian/Norwegian Sunstone
        content: |
          - **Inclusions**: Hematite or goethite platelets
          - **Effect**: Red-brown metallic sparkle
          - **Character**: Often more orange-brown
          - **Sources**: India, Norway, Tanzania

      title: The Only Copper Sunstone
      text: |
        Oregon sunstone is the only gem feldspar with native copper inclusions.
        This creates unique features:

        - Metallic copper-coloured sparkle
        - Some stones show red colour from copper
        - Can be bicoloured (green + red)
        - Transparent examples without schiller also valued
        - State gem of Oregon

  - title: Aventurine Quartz

      Aventurine is quartz with platy inclusions creating sparkle:
    subsections:
      - title: Green Aventurine
        content: |
          The most common type:

          - **Inclusions**: Fuchsite (chrome mica) flakes
          - **Colour**: Green from the fuchsite
          - **Character**: Translucent with sparkle
          - **Uses**: Cabochons, carvings, beads

      The phenomenon's namesake:
    subsections:
      - title: History
        content: |
          - Discovered accidentally in Murano, Italy (~17th century)
          - Copper filings fell into molten glass
          - Created sparkly decorative glass
          - Name transferred to natural materials

      - title: Identification
        content: |
          Distinguishing natural from glass aventurine:

          - Glass may have more uniform sparkle
          - Glass often shows gas bubbles
          - Glass SG differs from quartz (2.5 vs 2.65)
          - Glass often has different colour quality

  - title: Market Notes
    content: |
      Aventurescent gems in the market:

      - **Oregon sunstone**: Premium for copper stones; collector interest
      - **Green aventurine**: Common; affordable
      - **Sunstone general**: Popular for unique effect
      - **Treatment**: Not common; natural phenomenon
