  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Adularescence is the soft, billowy, bluish-white glow that moves across moonstone.
      It appears to float just below the surface and has a distinctly ethereal quality,
      unlike the sharper flashes of labradorescence.

      Named after Mount Adula in the Swiss Alps, where fine moonstone was historically
      found, adularescence is the defining phenomenon of gem moonstone.

      The physics behind adularescence:

      - title: Feldspar Structure
        content: |
          Moonstone is a feldspar with alternating layers of orthoclase and albite
          created during slow cooling (exsolution). When these layers are thin
          enough (approaching the wavelength of light), they scatter light through
          interference.

      - title: Layer Thickness and Colour
        content: |
          - **Thin layers** (~0.1 μm): Produce blue schiller (most valued)
          - **Thicker layers**: Produce white schiller
          - **Very thick layers**: No adularescence

          The thinner the layers, the shorter the wavelength scattered,
          producing the prized blue glow.

      title: Actually Labradorite
      text: |
        "Rainbow moonstone" is actually a variety of labradorite (plagioclase
        feldspar), not orthoclase moonstone. It shows multicoloured flashes
        (labradorescence) rather than true adularescence.

        True orthoclase moonstone shows a single-colour schiller (usually
        blue or white), not rainbow flashes.

      - title: Body Quality
        content: |
          - **Transparency**: More transparent = higher value
          - **Body colour**: Colourless to light grey preferred
          - **Clarity**: Fewer inclusions better
          - **Cut**: Well-proportioned cabochon

        - title: Adularescence (Moonstone)
          variant: default
          points:
            - Single-colour glow (blue or white)
            - Soft, billowy appearance
            - Appears to float below surface
            - Caused by layer interference
            - Orthoclase feldspar
        - title: Labradorescence (Labradorite)
          variant: default
          points:
            - Multiple spectral colours
            - Sharp, distinct flashes
            - Appears on surface
            - Caused by twinning interference
            - Plagioclase feldspar

  - title: Cutting for Adularescence
    content: |
      Proper orientation is critical:

      - Cut as cabochon (faceting destroys effect)
      - Orient to show schiller through dome
      - Appropriate dome height
      - Symmetrical shape for even display
      - Polish quality important for clarity

      title: Feldspar Fragility
      text: |
        Moonstone has perfect cleavage in two directions:

        - Vulnerable to hard knocks
        - Best in protective settings
        - Suitable for earrings, pendants, occasional rings
        - Avoid ultrasonic cleaning
        - Hardness only 6-6.5
