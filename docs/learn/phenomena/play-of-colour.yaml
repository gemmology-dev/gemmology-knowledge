  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Play of colour is the flashing spectral colours seen in precious opal. It is
      opal's defining characteristic and distinguishes precious opal from common
      opal (potch). The effect results from light diffraction by regularly arranged
      silica spheres within the opal structure.

      Unlike interference effects (adularescence, labradorescence), play of colour
      is a diffraction phenomenon, producing pure spectral colours that shift
      with viewing angle.

      The physics of play of colour:
    subsections:
      - title: Silica Sphere Structure
        content: |
          - Opal is composed of tiny silica spheres (SiO₂)
          - Spheres must be uniform in size (150-400nm)
          - Spheres must be regularly arranged in 3D array
          - Acts as a diffraction grating for light

      - title: Colour Determination
        content: |
          - **Sphere size determines colour**: Larger spheres = longer wavelengths
          - Spheres >350nm: Produce red (most valuable)
          - Spheres ~250nm: Produce green
          - Spheres ~150nm: Produce blue/violet
          - Regularity of arrangement determines brightness

          points:
            - Shows play of colour
            - Uniform sphere size
            - Regularly stacked spheres
            - 3D ordered structure
            - Gem quality

          variant: warning
          points:
            - No play of colour
            - Variable sphere sizes
            - Randomly arranged spheres
            - Disordered structure
            - Not gem quality

  - title: Pattern Types

      Opal patterns significantly affect value:

      title: Most Valuable Pattern
      text: |
        Harlequin pattern shows angular, mosaic-like patches of colour—
        similar to a clown's costume. Requirements:

        - Large, distinct colour patches
        - Angular or geometric shapes
        - Multiple colours present
        - Even distribution

        True harlequin is extremely rare and commands extraordinary premiums.

  - title: Colour Value Hierarchy
    content: |
      Not all colours are equally valued:
    subsections:
      - title: Colour Rankings
        content: |
          1. **Red**: Rarest (requires largest spheres); most valuable
          2. **Orange**: Second rarest
          3. **Green**: Middle value
          4. **Blue**: Most common play of colour; lower value

          An opal showing red (especially with other colours) is more
          valuable than one showing only blue.

      - title: Colour Range
        content: |
          - **Full spectrum**: Shows all colours; highly valued
          - **Partial spectrum**: Missing some colours; moderate
          - **Single colour**: Only one colour; lower value (usually blue)

  - title: Body Tone Impact

      Background colour affects value:

        - Body Tone
        - Effect on Play of Colour
        - Value Impact
      rows:
        - ["Black (N1-N4)", "Colours appear most vivid", "Highest value"]
        - ["Dark (N5-N6)", "Good colour contrast", "High value"]
        - ["Light (N7-N9)", "Softer appearance", "Moderate value"]
        - ["Crystal", "Transparent; colours from both sides", "Variable; can be high"]

  - title: Quality Assessment
    content: |
      Evaluating play of colour quality:

      - **Brightness**: How vivid are the colours?
      - **Colour range**: How many colours present?
      - **Pattern**: What type and how distinct?
      - **Distribution**: Even or concentrated?
      - **Directionality**: Visible from multiple angles?
      - **Dead spots**: Areas without colour?

    subsections:
      - title: Key Differences
        content: |
          - **Play of colour** (opal): Diffraction; pure spectral colours
          - **Labradorescence**: Interference; colours in patches
          - **Iridescence**: Thin-film; rainbow sequence
          - **Adularescence**: Interference; single colour glow

      - title: Physical Cause
        content: |
          - Opal: 3D sphere array (diffraction)
          - Labradorite: Twin lamellae (interference)
          - Iridescent gems: Surface layers (interference)
          - Moonstone: Exsolution layers (interference)
