  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Phenomenal gems display special optical effects caused by their internal structure,
      inclusions, or interference of light. These phenomena are highly prized and can
      significantly increase a gem's value.

      Understanding the causes of each phenomenon helps in identification, quality
      assessment, and distinguishing natural from synthetic or treated stones.

  - title: Types of Optical Phenomena
    content: |
      Gem phenomena can be grouped by their physical causes:
    subsections:
      - title: Reflection Effects
        content: |
          Caused by light reflecting from internal features:

          - **Asterism**: Star patterns from oriented needle inclusions
          - **Chatoyancy**: Cat's eye band from parallel inclusions
          - **Aventurescence**: Metallic sparkle from platy inclusions

      - title: Interference Effects
        content: |
          Caused by light interference between thin layers:

          - **Adularescence**: Soft glow in moonstone (feldspar layers)
          - **Labradorescence**: Colour flashes from twinning (labradorite)
          - **Iridescence**: Rainbow colours from thin films

      - title: Diffraction Effects
        content: |
          Caused by light diffraction from regular structures:

          - **Play of colour**: Spectral colours in opal (silica spheres)

      - title: Absorption Effects
        content: |
          Caused by selective absorption of light:

          - **Colour change**: Different colours under different lights

  - title: Value Impact
    content: |
      Phenomena can significantly affect gem value:
    subsections:
      - title: Premium Factors
        content: |
          - **Strength**: More pronounced effects command higher prices
          - **Quality**: Sharp, centred, complete effects preferred
          - **Rarity**: Uncommon phenomena in unusual gems valued
          - **Body colour**: Attractive underlying colour adds value

      - title: Quality Assessment
        content: |
          For phenomenal gems, assess:

          - Is the effect sharp and well-defined?
          - Is it centred and complete?
          - Does it move smoothly?
          - Is the body colour attractive?
          - Is the stone well cut to display the effect?

  - title: Cutting for Phenomena
    callout:
      type: tip
      title: Critical Orientation
      text: |
        Phenomenal gems require precise cutting orientation:

        - **Stars**: Base parallel to needle planes; dome centred
        - **Cat's eyes**: Cut perpendicular to needle direction
        - **Moonstone**: Oriented to show schiller through dome
        - **Opal**: Cut to display play of colour face-up

        Poor orientation can completely ruin a phenomenal stone's effect.
