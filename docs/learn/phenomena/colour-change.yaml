  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Colour-change gems display different colours under different light sources
      (typically daylight vs incandescent). The most famous is alexandrite, which
      appears green in daylight and red in incandescent light—often described as
      "emerald by day, ruby by night."

      This phenomenon results from the gem's absorption spectrum interacting
      differently with various light sources.

    content: |
      How colour change occurs:
    subsections:
      - title: The Physical Cause
        content: |
          - Gem's absorption spectrum has transmission windows in both red and green
          - Daylight is balanced across the spectrum → green component dominates
          - Incandescent light is red-rich → red component dominates
          - Eye perceives the dominant transmitted colour

      - title: Requirements
        content: |
          - Specific absorption spectrum with dual transmission windows
          - Usually involves chromium, vanadium, or iron chromophores
          - Balance between absorbed and transmitted wavelengths
          - Light source spectral composition must differ significantly

  - title: Alexandrite
    content: |
      Alexandrite is colour-change chrysoberyl—the most famous and valuable
      colour-change gem.
    subsections:
      - title: The Colour Change
        content: |
          - **Daylight/fluorescent**: Green to blue-green
          - **Incandescent**: Red to purple-red
          - **Cause**: Chromium (Cr³⁺) absorption
          - **Ideal**: Complete change from pure green to pure red

      - title: Grading Colour Change
        table:
          headers:
            - Percentage
            - Quality Description
          rows:
            - ["100%", "Complete change (pure green ↔ pure red)"]
            - ["75-99%", "Strong colour change"]
            - ["50-74%", "Moderate colour change"]
            - ["<50%", "Weak colour change"]

      - title: Quality Factors
        content: |
          - **Degree of change**: More complete = more valuable
          - **Attractiveness**: Both colours should be appealing
          - **Saturation**: Vivid colours in both lights
          - **Clarity**: Eye-clean preferred
          - **Size**: Large stones very rare

      title: The Ultimate Colour Change
      text: |
        Russian (Ural) alexandrite discovered in 1830 set the standard for
        colour change. The green matched Russian military colours; the red
        honoured the Tsar.

        Fine Russian alexandrite is essentially unavailable today. Stones
        with documented provenance command extraordinary prices at auction.

  - title: Colour-Change Garnet
    content: |
      Some of the most dramatic colour changes occur in garnet:
    subsections:
      - title: Characteristics
        content: |
          - Usually pyrope-spessartine composition
          - Can show blue-green to red-purple change
          - Some match alexandrite's change quality
          - Relatively rare

      - title: Sources
        content: |
          - Madagascar (best known)
          - Tanzania
          - Sri Lanka
          - USA (Idaho)

      title: Consistent Evaluation
      text: |
        Colour change should be evaluated under standardized lighting:

        - **Daylight**: North-facing window light or D65 fluorescent
        - **Incandescent**: Standard tungsten bulb (not LED)
        - **Avoid**: Mixed lighting, LED (variable spectra)

        Modern LED lights have variable spectra and may not show colour
        change the same way as traditional incandescent.

  - title: Market Considerations
    content: |
      Colour-change gems in the market:

      - **Alexandrite**: Extremely valuable; strong demand
      - **CC sapphire**: Premium over standard sapphire
      - **CC garnet**: Significant value when strong change
      - **Synthetic**: Synthetic colour-change gems exist (alexandrite, sapphire)
      - **Identification**: Chemical testing may be needed for species confirmation
