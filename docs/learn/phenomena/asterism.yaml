    content: |
      Asterism is the appearance of a star pattern on the surface of a cabochon-cut gem.
      It is caused by light reflecting from oriented needle-like inclusions (usually
      rutile silk) arranged parallel to crystallographic directions.

      Star rubies and star sapphires are the most important asteriated gems, though
      stars also occur in garnet, diopside, quartz, and other minerals.

  - title: How Stars Form
    content: |
      The formation of asterism requires specific conditions:
    subsections:
      - title: Requirements
        content: |
          - Needle inclusions oriented along **specific crystal directions**
          - Light reflects from each set of needles, creating a bright band
          - Multiple intersecting needle orientations create multiple rays
          - The stone must be cut **en cabochon** with base parallel to needle planes
          - Proper orientation during cutting is critical for centred stars

      Corundum is the most important source of star gems:
    subsections:
      - title: The Silk
        content: |
          - **Rutile (TiO₂)**: Tiny needle-like crystals
          - **Orientation**: Forms along hexagonal crystal axes
          - **Three sets**: At 120° angles to each other
          - **Creates**: Classic six-ray star

      items:
        - title: High Quality Stars
          variant: success
          points:
            - Sharp, well-defined rays
            - Complete rays from girdle to girdle
            - Centred on cabochon apex
            - Smooth, fluid movement
            - Attractive body colour
            - Good dome height
        - title: Low Quality Stars
          variant: warning
          points:
            - Fuzzy or diffuse rays
            - Incomplete or broken rays
            - Off-centre star position
            - Jerky or patchy movement
            - Poor body colour
            - Flat or overly high dome

      title: Identification Concerns
      text: |
        **Synthetic star corundum** (Linde stars):
        - Very sharp, perfectly straight rays
        - Often have gas bubbles
        - Rays may appear "too perfect"
        - Natural stars have slightly softer rays

        **Diffusion-treated stars**:
        - Star effect in thin surface layer only
        - Immersion reveals colour/silk at surface
        - Check for uneven colour distribution

  - title: Other Star Gems
    table:
      headers:
        - Gem
        - Star Type
        - Characteristics
      rows:
        - ["Star diopside", "4-ray", "Black body; distinct white cross"]
        - ["Star garnet", "4 or 6-ray", "Almandine; Idaho famous source"]
        - ["Star quartz", "6-ray", "Rose quartz; often weak"]
        - ["Star spinel", "6-ray", "Rare; collector interest"]
        - ["Star sunstone", "4-ray", "Oregon copper sunstone"]

  - title: Cutting Considerations
    content: |
      Proper cutting is essential for star quality:

      - **Base orientation**: Parallel to needle plane
      - **Dome height**: Adequate dome shows star better
      - **Centering**: Star should be centred on dome apex
      - **Symmetry**: Even cabochon shape
      - **Surface quality**: Good polish without scratches
