  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Iridescence is a display of spectral colours caused by light interference from
      thin layers or structures near the surface. Unlike opal's play of colour
      (diffraction from spheres), iridescence results from thin-film interference—
      the same phenomenon that creates colours in soap bubbles and oil slicks.

      Iridescence appears as rainbow sequences of colour that shift with viewing angle.

      The physics of iridescence:
    subsections:
      - title: Thin-Film Interference
        content: |
          - Light reflects from both top and bottom of thin layers
          - The two reflected waves interfere (add or cancel)
          - Layer thickness determines which wavelengths reinforce
          - Changing viewing angle changes apparent thickness → colour shifts

      - title: Requirements
        content: |
          - Thin layers (hundreds of nanometres thick)
          - Different refractive indices between layers
          - Transparent to semi-transparent layers
          - Regular or semi-regular layer structure

  - title: Surface vs Internal Iridescence
    comparison:
      items:
        - title: Surface Iridescence
          variant: default
          points:
            - Thin film on surface
            - May be coating or tarnish
            - Often from treatment
            - Examples - coated topaz, "mystic" gems
        - title: Internal Iridescence
          variant: default
          points:
            - Layers within the stone
            - Natural formation
            - More stable typically
            - Examples - fire agate, ammolite

  - title: Fire Agate
    content: |
      Fire agate shows iridescent "flames" from thin iron oxide layers:
    subsections:
      - title: Formation
        content: |
          - Layers of iron oxide (goethite/limonite) deposited during growth
          - Layers form over botryoidal (grape-like) chalcedony surface
          - Creates three-dimensional colour patterns
          - Each layer adds to interference effect

      - title: Characteristics
        content: |
          - **Colours**: Orange, red, green, gold, purple possible
          - **Pattern**: Flame-like or cellular
          - **Structure**: Botryoidal surface creates depth
          - **Source**: Primarily Mexico and southwestern USA

      - title: Cutting Approach
        content: |
          - Carved rather than cabochon cut
          - Must preserve botryoidal structure
          - Remove matrix carefully to expose colours
          - Skill required to maximise effect

  - title: Ammolite
    content: |
      Ammolite is fossilised ammonite shell from Alberta, Canada:
    subsections:
      - title: Formation
        content: |
          - Fossilised nacre (aragonite) from ammonite shells
          - ~70 million years old (Cretaceous period)
          - Thin nacre layers create interference
          - Found only in Alberta's Bearpaw Formation

      - title: Characteristics
        content: |
          - **Colours**: Full spectrum possible; red-green common
          - **Pattern**: Broad colour areas; some patterning
          - **Fragility**: Very thin layer; requires protection
          - **Doublets/triplets**: Often assembled for durability

          rows:
            - ["AA", "3+ colours including red/violet", "Exceptional"]
            - ["A+", "3+ colours", "Very good"]
            - ["A", "1-2 colours", "Good"]
            - ["B", "Less vivid colours", "Commercial"]

  - title: Ammolite Protection
    callout:
      type: warning
      title: Fragile Material
      text: |
        Natural ammolite is very thin and fragile:

        - Often made into doublets (backing) or triplets (backing + cap)
        - Quartz or synthetic spinel cap protects surface
        - Shale or plastic backing provides strength
        - Solid (natural) ammolite is rarer and more valuable
        - Avoid ultrasonic; clean gently

  - title: Iris Quartz
    content: |
      Iridescence in quartz from internal fractures:

      - **Cause**: Thin air-filled fractures
      - **Effect**: Rainbow colours along fracture planes
      - **Character**: Often seen in crystal slices
      - **Natural vs enhanced**: Some is artificially fractured

  - title: Treated Iridescence
    content: |
      Surface treatments creating iridescence:
    subsections:
      - title: Coated Gems
        content: |
          - **Mystic topaz**: Titanium coating creates rainbow
          - **Aurora quartz**: Various coating treatments
          - **Coated calcite**: Decorative only
          - **Detection**: Surface colour; coating may show wear

      - title: Identification Concerns
        content: |
          - Coatings can wear off
          - Examine edges and girdle for coating
          - May show interference patterns in reflected light
          - Must be disclosed as treatment
