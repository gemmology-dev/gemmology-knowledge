  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Labradorescence is the striking play of colours seen in labradorite feldspar.
      Unlike the soft single-colour glow of adularescence, labradorescence displays
      a full spectrum of colours including blue, green, gold, orange, and purple
      in distinct flashes.

      First identified in specimens from Labrador, Canada in 1770, this phenomenon
      creates some of the most visually dramatic effects in the gem world.

  - title: Mechanism

      The cause of labradorescence:
    subsections:
      - title: Lamellar Twinning
        content: |
          - Caused by light interference from repeated thin twin layers
          - Twin lamellae form during cooling of plagioclase
          - Lamellae vary in thickness, producing different colours
          - Light interferes between twin boundaries

      - title: Orientation Dependence
        content: |
          - Most prominent on specific crystal planes (001 cleavage)
          - Requires proper cutting orientation to display effect
          - Colours appear in patches or broad flashes
          - Tilting the stone reveals different colour areas

  - title: Colour Range
    content: |
      Labradorescence can display nearly the full spectrum:

      - **Blue**: Most common colour seen
      - **Green**: Often with blue
      - **Gold/yellow**: Warm tones
      - **Orange**: Vivid examples exist
      - **Red**: Rarer; highly prized
      - **Purple**: Less common

      Multiple colours in one stone are typical and valued.

      title: Full Spectrum Finnish Labradorite
      text: |
        Spectrolite is Finnish labradorite that shows the full colour spectrum:

        - Displays vivid blues, greens, oranges, purples in one stone
        - Discovered in Finland during WWII (1940)
        - Named for its spectral colour range
        - Commands premium prices for fine examples
        - More vivid and varied than typical labradorite

  - title: Labradorescence vs Adularescence
    comparison:
      items:
        - title: Labradorescence
          variant: default
          points:
            - Multiple spectral colours
            - Sharp, distinct flashes
            - Colours appear in patches
            - Caused by lamellar twinning
            - Plagioclase (labradorite)
            - Effect at surface level
        - title: Adularescence
          variant: default
          points:
            - Single colour (blue or white)
            - Soft, floating glow
            - Even, billowy appearance
            - Caused by layer exsolution
            - Alkali feldspar (orthoclase)
            - Appears below surface

  - title: Cutting Considerations
    content: |
      Proper cutting maximises labradorescence:
    subsections:
      - title: Orientation
        content: |
          - Cut to display colours face-up
          - Align with cleavage plane for best effect
          - May sacrifice weight for optimal display
          - Flat backs common to maximise colour area

      - title: Cut Styles
        content: |
          - **Cabochons**: Traditional; shows colours well
          - **Flat slabs**: Maximises colour display area
          - **Faceted**: Possible but reduces phenomenon visibility
          - **Carvings**: Popular for decorative pieces

  - title: Market and Value
    content: |
      Labradorite market considerations:

      - **Spectrolite**: Highest prices for fine Finnish material
      - **Collector stones**: Fine multi-colour specimens valued
      - **Decorative use**: Popular for tiles, countertops
      - **Jewellery**: Growing popularity for unique pieces
      - **Size**: Large pieces available (unlike many gems)
