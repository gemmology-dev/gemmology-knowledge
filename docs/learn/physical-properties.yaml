  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Physical properties are essential for gem identification and determining
      suitability for different types of jewellery. These properties depend on
      the crystal structure and chemical composition.

  - title: Hardness
    content: |
      Hardness measures a mineral's resistance to scratching. The **Mohs scale**
      ranks minerals from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond), but the scale is not linear—diamond
      is approximately 140 times harder than corundum.

        - Hardness
        - Mineral Standard
        - Common Gemstones
      rows:
        - ["10", "Diamond", "Diamond"]
        - ["9", "Corundum", "Ruby, Sapphire"]
        - ["8", "Topaz", "Topaz, Spinel, Chrysoberyl"]
        - ["7", "Quartz", "Amethyst, Citrine, Tourmaline"]
        - ["6-7", "Feldspar", "Peridot, Jadeite"]
        - ["5-6", "Apatite", "Opal, Turquoise"]

      title: Practical Considerations
      text: |
        - Gems with hardness <7 can be scratched by dust (quartz particles)
        - Ring stones should ideally be hardness 7 or above
        - Hardness can vary by direction (kyanite: 4-7)

  - title: Specific Gravity (SG)
    content: |
      Specific gravity is the ratio of a gem's density to that of water. It's a
      diagnostic property that can be measured without damaging the stone using
      hydrostatic weighing.

      **Formula:** `SG = Weight in air / (Weight in air - Weight in water)`
    table:

      headers:
        - Range
        - Gemstones
      rows:
        - ["2.0-2.5", "Opal (2.15), Amber (1.08)"]
        - ["2.5-3.0", "Quartz (2.65), Feldspar (2.56-2.76)"]
        - ["3.0-3.5", "Tourmaline (3.06), Jadeite (3.34)"]
        - ["3.5-4.0", "Diamond (3.52), Topaz (3.53), Spinel (3.60)"]
        - ["4.0-4.5", "Corundum (4.00), Zircon (4.69)"]
        - [">5.0", "High zircon (4.69), Cassiterite (7.0)"]

  - title: Cleavage
    content: |
      Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along flat planes related to
      its crystal structure. These planes are directions of weaker atomic bonding.

        - Examples
      rows:
        - ["Perfect", "Very smooth, flat surfaces", "Topaz {001}, Fluorite {111}"]
        - ["Good", "Relatively flat but may be stepped", "Feldspar, Spodumene"]
        - ["Distinct", "Recognizable but not dominant", "Beryl (imperfect)"]
        - ["Poor/None", "No preferred break direction", "Quartz, Garnet"]

      title: Cleavage Hazards
      text: |
        Gems with perfect cleavage require careful handling during cutting and setting.
        Diamond has perfect octahedral cleavage {111}, which is used in cleaving
        but makes it vulnerable to sharp blows in certain directions.

  - title: Fracture
    content: |
      Fracture describes how a mineral breaks in directions other than cleavage planes.
    table:
      headers:
        - Type
        - Appearance
        - Examples
      rows:
        - ["Conchoidal", "Curved, shell-like surfaces", "Quartz, Glass, Obsidian"]
        - ["Uneven", "Rough, irregular surface", "Jadeite"]
        - ["Splintery", "Fibrous or needle-like", "Nephrite"]
        - ["Hackly", "Jagged, sharp edges", "Native metals"]

  - title: Lustre
    content: |
      Lustre describes how light interacts with a mineral's surface. It depends on
      the refractive index and surface quality.
    table:
      headers:
        - Lustre
        - Description
        - Examples
      rows:
        - ["Adamantine", "Brilliant, diamond-like (RI >1.9)", "Diamond, Zircon"]
        - ["Vitreous", "Glass-like (most common)", "Quartz, Beryl, Tourmaline"]
        - ["Resinous", "Like resin or plastic", "Amber, Sphalerite"]
        - ["Waxy", "Like candle wax", "Turquoise, Chalcedony"]
        - ["Pearly", "Iridescent, like pearl", "Moonstone, some feldspar"]
        - ["Silky", "Like silk fabric", "Tiger's eye, Satin spar"]

  - title: Tenacity
    content: |
      Tenacity describes a mineral's resistance to breaking, bending, or crushing:

      - **Brittle** - Shatters when struck (most gemstones)
      - **Tough** - Resists breaking despite lower hardness (nephrite, jadeite)
      - **Sectile** - Can be cut with a knife
      - **Flexible** - Bends but doesn't return (mica)
      - **Elastic** - Bends and returns to shape

      title: Toughness vs. Hardness
      text: |
        Nephrite jade (H: 6-6.5) is tougher than diamond (H: 10) because its interlocking
        fibrous structure resists fracture. This makes jade ideal for carving despite
        its lower hardness.
