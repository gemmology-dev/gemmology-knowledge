## Fundamentals

### [Crystal Systems](crystal-systems.md)
The seven crystal systems and their characteristic symmetry elements. Learn about axes, angles, and how crystal structure affects gemstone properties.

### [Advanced Crystallography](crystallography-advanced.md)
Twinning, Miller indices deep dive, crystal habits, the 32 point groups, and crystal growth mechanisms. Essential for FGA Diploma.

### [Physical Properties](physical-properties.md)
Hardness, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, lustre, and tenacity. Includes SG measurement techniques, directional hardness, and thermal conductivity.

### [Chemical Properties](chemical-properties.md)
Gem chemistry, chromophores and colour causes, allochromatic vs idiochromatic minerals, charge transfer mechanisms, and colour centres.

### [Optical Properties](optical-properties.md)
Refractive index, birefringence, pleochroism, dispersion, and absorption spectra. The most important diagnostic features for gem identification.

### [Advanced Optical Properties](optical-properties-advanced.md)
Interference figures, optic sign determination, complete absorption spectra reference, luminescence, and anomalous double refraction (ADR).

## Identification

### [Gem Testing Instruments](gem-testing-instruments.md)
Comprehensive guide to refractometer, polariscope, dichroscope, spectroscope, Chelsea filter, UV lamp, and microscope. Essential practical skills for FGA Foundation.

### [Inclusions](inclusions.md)
Diagnostic inclusions and fingerprinting techniques. Covers corundum, emerald, diamond, garnet, spinel, and more. Learn to identify gemstones and determine origin through their internal features.

### [Treatments](treatments.md)
Heat treatment, filling, diffusion, coating, irradiation, HPHT diamond treatment, and detection methods. Includes treatment stability chart and laboratory report terminology.

### [Synthetics](synthetics.md)
Synthetic gem production methods including flame fusion, flux growth, hydrothermal, CVD, and HPHT diamond. Detection techniques, historical timeline, and market evolution.

### [Composite Stones](composite-stones.md)
Doublets, triplets, and assembled stones including opal doublets, garnet-topped doublets, and soudé emeralds. Detection methods and disclosure requirements.

## Advanced Topics

### [Phenomenal Gems](phenomenal-gems.md)
Optical phenomena including asterism (star effect), chatoyancy (cat's eye), adularescence, labradorescence, play of colour, colour change, and aventurescence.

### [Origin Determination](origin-determination.md)
Geographic origin determination for gemstones. Kashmir sapphire, Burmese ruby, Colombian emerald, and more. Inclusion suites, trace elements, and origin premiums.

### [Grading and Valuation](grading-valuation.md)
Colour grading (hue, tone, saturation), clarity assessment, cut quality, carat weight, and value factors. Professional grading techniques for coloured gemstones.

### [Gem Care and Durability](gem-care-durability.md)
Gemstone stability, cleaning methods (ultrasonic, steam, safe practices), setting recommendations, and storage guidelines. Jewellery suitability by gem species.

### [Professional Practice](professional-practice.md)
Report writing, disclosure requirements, legal aspects, professional ethics, and laboratory certification. CIBJO terminology and trade organisation standards.

## Supplementary Content

### [Diamond](diamond.md)
Diamond type classification (Ia, IaA, IaB, Ib, IIa, IIb), the 4Cs grading system, fancy colours, natural vs lab-grown identification, and verification instruments.

### [Organic Gems](organic-gems.md)
Pearl (natural, cultured, saltwater, freshwater), coral, amber, jet, shell materials, and ivory alternatives. Grading factors and special care requirements.

## FGA Curriculum Alignment

This content is aligned with the [Gem-A](https://gem-a.com) (Gemmological Association of Great Britain) FGA diploma curriculum:

**Foundation Coverage:**
- Crystal systems and physical properties
- Optical properties and gem testing instruments
- Introduction to inclusions, treatments, and synthetics
- Basic gem identification techniques

**Diploma Coverage:**
- Advanced crystallography and optical properties
- Origin determination and inclusion fingerprinting
- Treatment detection and synthetic identification
- Grading, valuation, and professional practice
- Phenomenal gems and special optical effects

While comprehensive, this resource is not a substitute for formal gemmological education and hands-on training with reference stones.

## Data Format

The learn content is stored as structured YAML data files that can be rendered by multiple platforms:

- **gemmology.dev** - Interactive web experience with crystal visualizations
- **MkDocs** - Static documentation site (this site)
- **API** - Programmatic access to gemmological data

Source files are located in `docs/learn/*.yaml`.
