# Learn Gemmology

FGA curriculum-aligned content covering crystallography, physical and optical properties, inclusions, treatments, and synthetics.

!!! info "Interactive Content"
    For the best learning experience with interactive crystal visualizations and structured data tables, visit [gemmology.dev/learn](https://gemmology.dev/learn).

## Fundamentals

### [Crystal Systems](crystal-systems.md)
The seven crystal systems and their characteristic symmetry elements. Learn about axes, angles, and how crystal structure affects gemstone properties.

### [Physical Properties](physical-properties.md)
Hardness, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and lustre. Essential properties for gem identification and durability assessment.

### [Optical Properties](optical-properties.md)
Refractive index, birefringence, pleochroism, dispersion, and absorption spectra. The most important diagnostic features for gem identification.

## Identification

### [Inclusions](inclusions.md)
Diagnostic inclusions and fingerprinting techniques. Learn to identify gemstones and determine origin through their internal features.

### [Treatments](treatments.md)
Heat treatment, filling, diffusion, coating, and detection methods. Understanding treatments is essential for accurate identification and proper disclosure.

## Advanced

### [Synthetics](synthetics.md)
Synthetic gem production methods including flame fusion, flux growth, hydrothermal, CVD, and HPHT. Detection techniques for lab-grown gems.

## FGA Curriculum Alignment

This content is aligned with the [Gem-A](https://gem-a.com) (Gemmological Association of Great Britain) FGA diploma curriculum. While comprehensive, this resource is not a substitute for formal gemmological education and hands-on training with reference stones.

## Data Format

The learn content is stored as structured YAML data files that can be rendered by multiple platforms:

- **gemmology.dev** - Interactive web experience with crystal visualizations
- **MkDocs** - Static documentation site (this site)
- **API** - Programmatic access to gemmological data

Source files are located in `docs/learn/*.yaml`.
