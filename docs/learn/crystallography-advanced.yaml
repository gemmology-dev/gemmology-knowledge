  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Advanced crystallography builds on the foundation of crystal systems to explore
      how crystals grow, twin, and develop their characteristic forms. Understanding
      these concepts is essential for interpreting inclusion patterns, growth features,
      and crystal morphology.

      The FGA Diploma requires ability to draw common crystal habits and understand
      twinning patterns—these visual skills are tested in examinations.

  - title: Miller Indices
    content: |
      Miller indices describe the orientation of crystal faces relative to crystallographic
      axes. They are fundamental to describing crystal forms and understanding
      morphology.
    subsections:
      - title: Three-Index Notation {hkl}
        content: |
          For cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic systems:

          1. Determine where face intercepts each axis (a, b, c)
          2. Take reciprocals of these intercepts
          3. Clear fractions to get smallest integers
          4. Enclose in braces {hkl} for a form (set of symmetrically equivalent faces)
          5. Use parentheses (hkl) for a single specific face

          **Example**: Face intercepts a at 1, b at 2, c at ∞
          - Reciprocals: 1/1, 1/2, 1/∞ = 1, 0.5, 0
          - Clear fractions: multiply by 2 → 2, 1, 0
          - Miller index: (210)

      - title: Common Cubic Forms
        table:
          headers:
            - Form
            - Miller Index
            - Face Count
            - Shape
          rows:
            - ["Cube", "{100}", "6", "Square faces"]
            - ["Octahedron", "{111}", "8", "Triangular faces"]
            - ["Dodecahedron", "{110}", "12", "Rhombic faces"]

            - ["Hexoctahedron", "{321}", "48", "Scalene triangles"]

      - title: Four-Index Notation {hkil}
        content: |
          For hexagonal and trigonal systems, four-index (Miller-Bravais) notation uses
          three horizontal axes (a₁, a₂, a₃) at 120° plus vertical c-axis:

          - h + k + i = 0 (always; i is redundant but clarifies symmetry)
          - Negative indices shown with bar: 1̄ or written as -1

          **Example**: {10-10} = {101̄0} = hexagonal prism faces

          Common hexagonal/trigonal forms:
          - {0001} - Basal pinacoid (top and bottom)
          - {10-10} - Hexagonal prism
          - {10-11} - Hexagonal dipyramid
          - {11-20} - Second-order prism

  - title: Crystal Forms
    content: |
      A crystal form is a set of faces that are equivalent by symmetry. Forms can be
      open (don't enclose space alone) or closed (can exist independently).
    subsections:
      - title: Open vs Closed Forms
        comparison:
          items:
            - title: Open Forms
              points:
                - Cannot exist alone
                - Must combine with other forms
                - "Examples: prisms, pinacoids"
                - Require top/bottom faces
            - title: Closed Forms
              points:
                - Can exist independently
                - Enclose space completely
                - "Examples: cube, octahedron"
                - All faces equivalent

      - title: Form Combinations
        content: |
          Real crystals typically show multiple forms in combination:

          - **Dominant form**: Largest faces, determines overall shape
          - **Modifying forms**: Smaller faces, truncate edges/corners
          - **CDL notation**: `{111}@1.0 + {100}@1.3` describes relative development

          Example: Diamond often shows {111} octahedron with {100} cube faces
          truncating corners.

  - title: Twinning
    content: |
      Twinning occurs when two or more crystals share some lattice points but have
      different orientations. Twins can form during growth, transformation, or
      mechanical stress.

      - title: Twin Laws
        content: |
          A twin law describes the geometric relationship between twin parts:

          - **Twin plane**: Mirror plane relating the parts
          - **Twin axis**: Rotation axis (typically 180°)
          - **Contact vs penetration**: Whether parts share plane or interpenetrate

          Common twin laws include spinel law {111}, Brazil law in quartz, and
          Carlsbad law in orthoclase.

      title: Twinning and Optical Properties
      text: |
        Twinning affects optical properties and can complicate identification:

        - Polysynthetic twinning causes labradorescence in labradorite
        - Brazil twinning in quartz creates optical irregularities
        - Twin planes can be mistaken for cleavage
        - Twinning may cause anomalous optical behaviour under polariscope

  - title: Crystal Habits
    content: |
      Crystal habit describes the overall shape a mineral typically assumes. The same
      mineral can show different habits depending on growth conditions.
    subsections:
      - title: Common Habit Terms
        table:
          headers:

            - ["Massive", "No visible crystal faces", "Jadeite, nephrite"]
            - ["Botryoidal", "Grape-like rounded masses", "Malachite, chalcedony"]

      - title: Habit Variations
        content: |
          The same mineral may show different habits due to:

          - **Growth rate**: Fast growth → elongated; slow growth → equant
          - **Temperature**: Higher temperatures often favour specific faces
          - **Impurities**: Can block growth on certain faces
          - **Available space**: Constrained environments modify shape
          - **Supersaturation**: Affects relative face development

  - title: Crystal Growth
    content: |
      Understanding crystal growth explains many inclusion patterns, zoning features,
      and quality characteristics observed in gems.
    subsections:
      - title: Growth Mechanisms
        content: |
          Crystals grow by atoms/molecules attaching to energetically favourable sites:

          - **Layer growth**: Atoms add to stepped surfaces
          - **Screw dislocation growth**: Spiral growth patterns
          - **Dendritic growth**: Fast growth → branching patterns
          - **Skeletal growth**: Edges grow faster than faces

      - title: Natural vs Synthetic Growth
        content: |
          Growth features help distinguish natural from synthetic gems:

          - **Natural**: Irregular zoning, varied inclusion suites, geological timeframe
          - **Flame fusion**: Curved striae from rotating growth
          - **Flux growth**: Flux inclusions, metallic platelets
          - **Hydrothermal**: Chevron zoning, seed plates

        The FGA Diploma requires ability to draw basic crystal shapes. Practice drawing:

        1. Cube (6 square faces)
        2. Octahedron (8 triangular faces)
        3. Hexagonal prism (6 rectangular + 2 hexagonal faces)
        4. Rhombohedron (6 rhombic faces)
        5. Orthorhombic prism with dome

        Use proper perspective and indicate symmetry elements where relevant.
