## Hardness

Hardness measures a mineral's resistance to scratching. The **Mohs scale** ranks minerals from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond).

| Hardness | Mineral | Common Gemstones |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| 10 | Diamond | Diamond |
| 9 | Corundum | Ruby, Sapphire |
| 8 | Topaz | Topaz, Spinel |
| 7 | Quartz | Amethyst, Tourmaline |

!!! warning "Practical Note"
    Gems with hardness <7 can be scratched by dust (quartz particles). Ring stones should ideally be hardness 7 or above.

## Specific Gravity

Specific gravity is the ratio of a gem's density to that of water.

**Formula:** `SG = Weight in air / (Weight in air - Weight in water)`

## Cleavage

Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along flat planes related to its crystal structure.

| Quality | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Perfect | Very smooth surfaces | Topaz, Fluorite |
| Good | Relatively flat | Feldspar |
| Poor/None | No preferred direction | Quartz, Garnet |

## Lustre

| Lustre | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Adamantine | Brilliant (RI >1.9) | Diamond, Zircon |
| Vitreous | Glass-like | Quartz, Beryl |
| Waxy | Like candle wax | Turquoise |
