  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      Synthetic gems have the same chemical composition, crystal structure, and physical
      properties as their natural counterparts. They are created in laboratories using
      various growth methods.

      title: Terminology
      text: |
        **Synthetic** - Same composition and structure as natural (lab-grown ruby is synthetic corundum)

        **Simulant** - Different material that resembles another (CZ simulates diamond)

        **Imitation** - Any material used to imitate another (glass "ruby")

  - title: Flame Fusion (Verneuil Process)
    content: |
      Invented in 1902, this is the oldest and most economical method. Powdered chemicals
      are dropped through a high-temperature flame, melting and crystallizing on a
      rotating pedestal.

      headers:
        - Feature
        - Description
      rows:
        - ["Curved striae", "Diagnostic curved growth lines (vs. straight in natural)"]
        - ["Gas bubbles", "Spherical or elongated bubbles"]
        - ["Colour", "Often more uniform than natural"]
        - ["Growth rate", "Fast (hours to days)"]
    subsections:
      - title: Materials Produced
        content: |
          - Ruby and sapphire (all colours)
          - Star ruby and star sapphire
          - Spinel (various colours)
          - Rutile (diamond simulant, now rare)
          - Strontium titanate (diamond simulant)

  - title: Flux Growth
    content: |
      Crystals grow slowly from a molten flux solution at high temperatures. This produces
      high-quality crystals with natural-looking inclusions.

      caption: Flux Growth Characteristics
      headers:
        - Feature
        - Description
      rows:
        - ["Flux inclusions", "Wispy veils, fingerprints, flux \"pools\""]
        - ["Metallic platelets", "Platinum or gold from crucible"]
        - ["Colour zoning", "May be present but different pattern from natural"]
        - ["Growth rate", "Slow (months)"]
    subsections:
      - title: Notable Producers
        content: |
          - **Chatham** - Emerald, ruby, sapphire, alexandrite
          - **Ramaura** - Ruby (very natural-looking)
          - **Kashan** - Ruby
          - **Kyocera (Inamori)** - Emerald, ruby

  - title: Hydrothermal Growth
    content: |
      Crystals grow in high-pressure aqueous solutions, mimicking natural conditions.
      Used primarily for quartz and emerald.

        - ["Nail-head spicules", "Characteristic pointed inclusions"]
        - ["Two-phase inclusions", "Different appearance from natural"]
    subsections:
      - title: Materials Produced
        content: |
          - Quartz (amethyst, citrine, ametrine)
          - Emerald (Biron, Regency, Tairus)
          - Ruby and sapphire (some producers)

  - title: Czochralski (Pulling) Method
    content: |
      A seed crystal is dipped into molten material and slowly pulled upward, growing
      a single crystal. Used mainly for technical applications and some gem materials.

      - YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) - diamond simulant
      - GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) - diamond simulant
      - Alexandrite (Czochralski and floating zone)

      Lab-grown diamonds are produced by two main methods.

      items:
        - title: HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature)
          points:
            - Mimics natural diamond formation
            - Metallic flux catalyst
            - Often yellow tint (nitrogen)
            - Metallic inclusions possible
            - Strong magnetic under UV
        - title: CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition)
          points:
            - Carbon deposited from gas
            - Lower pressure process
            - Often brown (can be HPHT treated)
            - Striated growth patterns
            - May show weak fluorescence

      title: Professional Testing
      text: |
        While many synthetics can be identified with standard gemmological equipment,
        some high-quality synthetics and lab-grown diamonds require advanced laboratory
        testing (spectroscopy, photoluminescence imaging) for definitive identification.
