# Glossary

Gemmological terminology definitions.

## A

**Adularescence**
: A billowy, floating light effect seen in moonstone, caused by light scattering from thin layers of orthoclase and albite feldspar.

**Allochromatic**
: A mineral that is colourless when pure, with colour caused by trace impurities (e.g., corundum, beryl).

**Anomalous Double Refraction (ADR)**
: Birefringence observed in normally isotropic materials due to strain, common in garnet and spinel.

**Asterism**
: A star effect caused by light reflecting from oriented needle-like inclusions, typically silk in corundum.

## B

**Birefringence**
: The numerical difference between the highest and lowest refractive index values in a doubly refractive gem.

**Brilliance**
: The amount of light returned from a gemstone through its crown.

## C

**Cabochon**
: A gem cut with a domed top and flat or domed back, typically used for opaque gems or those displaying phenomena.

**Carat**
: Unit of weight for gemstones, equal to 0.2 grams or 200 milligrams.

**Chatoyancy**
: The cat's eye effect, a single bright band of light across a domed cabochon.

**Chromophore**
: An element responsible for colour in gemstones (e.g., chromium in ruby, iron in aquamarine).

**Cleavage**
: The tendency of a mineral to break along specific crystallographic planes of atomic weakness.

**Crown**
: The upper portion of a faceted gemstone, above the girdle.

## D

**Dichroism**
: The property of showing two different colours when viewed along different crystallographic axes.

**Dispersion**
: The separation of white light into spectral colours as it passes through a material; causes "fire" in diamonds.

**Doublet**
: A composite stone made of two parts cemented or fused together.

## E

**Extinction**
: In a polariscope, the darkness observed when a birefringent gem is rotated to certain positions.

## F

**Facet**
: A flat, polished surface on a cut gemstone.

**Fire**
: Flashes of spectral colours seen in a gemstone due to dispersion.

**Fluorescence**
: The emission of visible light by a material when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.

**Fracture**
: The way a mineral breaks along surfaces other than cleavage planes.

## G

**Girdle**
: The narrow rim around a cut gemstone that separates the crown from the pavilion.

**Growth zoning**
: Colour or inclusion patterns that reflect a gem's growth history.

## H

**Habit**
: The characteristic external shape of a crystal.

**Hardness**
: Resistance to scratching, measured on the Mohs scale.

## I

**Idiochromatic**
: A mineral whose colour is caused by essential elements in its chemical composition (e.g., peridot, turquoise).

**Inclusion**
: Any material trapped within a gemstone during or after formation.

**Isotropic**
: Having the same optical properties in all directions; singly refractive.

## J

**Jardín**
: French for "garden"; refers to the characteristic inclusion pattern in emerald.

## L

**Labradorescence**
: The play of spectral colours seen in labradorite, caused by light interference from lamellar twinning.

**Lustre**
: The quality and quantity of light reflected from a gem's surface.

## M

**Miller indices**
: A notation system for identifying crystal faces using three or four integers in curly braces.

**Mohs scale**
: The 10-point relative hardness scale used for minerals.

## O

**Optical character**
: Whether a gem is singly refractive (isotropic) or doubly refractive (anisotropic), and if doubly refractive, whether uniaxial or biaxial.

**Optic sign**
: Whether a uniaxial or biaxial gem is optically positive (+) or negative (-).

## P

**Pavilion**
: The lower portion of a faceted gemstone, below the girdle.

**Phenomenon**
: Special optical effects in gemstones such as asterism, chatoyancy, or play of colour.

**Play of colour**
: The spectral colour flashes seen in precious opal, caused by diffraction from silica spheres.

**Pleochroism**
: The property of showing different colours when viewed along different crystallographic axes.

**Point group**
: One of the 32 classes of crystal symmetry.

## R

**Refractive index (RI)**
: A measure of how much light slows and bends when entering a material.

## S

**Silk**
: Fine, needle-like rutile inclusions in corundum that can cause asterism.

**Simulant**
: Any material used to imitate the appearance of a gemstone.

**Specific gravity (SG)**
: The ratio of a material's density to that of water.

**Synthetic**
: A man-made material with essentially the same chemical composition and crystal structure as its natural counterpart.

## T

**Table**
: The large, flat facet on top of a cut gemstone.

**Toughness**
: Resistance to breaking, chipping, or cracking.

**Trichroism**
: The property of showing three different colours when viewed along different crystallographic axes.

**Triplet**
: A composite stone made of three parts cemented or fused together.

**Twinning**
: The intergrowth of two or more crystals of the same mineral in a specific crystallographic relationship.

## U

**Uniaxial**
: Having one optic axis; characteristic of tetragonal, hexagonal, and trigonal crystals.

## V

**Vitreous**
: Glass-like lustre.

## W

**Window**
: An area in a cut gemstone where light passes straight through without being reflected back, appearing pale or washed out.

## Z

**Zoning**
: Variation in colour intensity within a gemstone, typically following growth patterns.
